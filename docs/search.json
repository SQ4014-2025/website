    "text": "Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes\nFive hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear\nFive hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes\nHow do you measure, measure a year?\n— “Seasons of Love,” Rent\n\nAssuming there are 365 days in a year, there are (365 = 525,600) minutes in that same year (because there are 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour). But how many minutes are there in two or more years? Well, it depends on how many of those are leap years with 366 days, per the Gregorian calendar, as some of them could have (1 = 1,440) additional minutes. In fact, how many minutes has it been since you were born? Well, that, too, depends on how many leap years there have been since! There is an algorithm for such, but let’s not reinvent that wheel. Let’s use a library instead. Fortunately, Python comes with a datetime module that has a class called date that can help, per docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#date-objects.\nIn a file called seasons.py, implement a program that prompts the user for their date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format and then sings prints how old they are in minutes, rounded to the nearest integer, using English words instead of numerals, just like the song from Rent, without any and between words. Since a user might not know the time at which they were born, assume, for simplicity, that the user was born at midnight (i.e., 00:00:00) on that date. And assume that the current time is also midnight. In other words, even if the user runs the program at noon, assume that it’s actually midnight, on the same date. Use datetime.date.today to get today’s date, per docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.today.\nStructure your program per the below, not only with a main function but also with one or more other functions as well:\nfrom datetime import date\n\n\ndef main():\n    ...\n\n\n...\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nYou’re welcome to import other (built-in) libraries, or any that are specified in the below hints. Exit via sys.exit if the user does not input a date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Ensure that your program will not raise any exceptions.\nEither before or after you implement seasons.py, additionally implement, in a file called test_seasons.py, one or more functions that test your implementation of any functions besides main in seasons.py thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:\npytest test_seasons.py\n\n\n\n\nNote that the date class comes with quite a few methods and “supported operations,” per docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#date-objects. In particular, the class implements __sub__, per docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.__sub__, overloading - in such a way that subtracting one date object from another returns a timedelta object, which itself comes with several (read-only) “instance attributes,” per docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects.\nNote that the inflect module comes with quite a few methods, per pypi.org/project/inflect. You can install it with:\npip install inflect\n\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:\n$\n\nNext execute\nmkdir seasons\n\nto make a folder called seasons in your codespace.\nThen execute\ncd seasons\n\nto change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as seasons/ $. You can now execute\ncode seasons.py\n\nto make a file called seasons.py where you’ll write your program. Be sure to also execute\ncode test_seasons.py\n\nto create a file called test_seasons.py where you’ll write tests for your program.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how to test seasons.py manually:\n\nRun your program with python seasons.py. Ensure your program prompts you for a birthdate. Type a date one year ago from today, in the specified format, then press Enter. Your program should sing print Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes. If this is a leap year, there should be one more day’s worth of minutes, so expect Five hundred twenty-seven thousand forty minutes instead!\nRun your program with python seasons.py. Type a date two years ago from today, in the specified format, then press Enter. Your program should print One million, fifty-one thousand, two hundred minutes (or One million, fifty-two thousand, six hundred forty minutes in a leap year).\nRun your program with python seasons.py. Type a date of your choice, but this time use an invalid format. Press Enter and your program should exit using sys.exit without raising an Exception.\n\n\n\n\nTo test your tests, run pytest test_seasons.py. Try to use correct and incorrect versions of seasons.py to determine how well your tests spot errors:\n\nEnsure you have a correct version of seasons.py. Run your tests by executing pytest test_seasons.py. pytest should show that all of your tests have passed.\nModify one of the functions you’ve implemented in seasons.py and imported into test_seasons.py. One of your functions might, for example, fail to raise a ValueError when it should. Run your tests by executing pytest test_seasons.py. pytest should show that at least one of your tests has failed.\nContinue to modify the behavior of seasons.py, creating (predictably) incorrect versions of your implementation. Run your tests by executing pytest test_seasons.py. Do the tests you expect to fail, fail?"

    "text": "A famous place for pizza in Harvard Square is Pinocchio’s Pizza & Subs, aka Noch’s, known for its Sicilian pizza, which is “a deep-dish or thick-crust pizza.”\nStudents on the university campus tend to buy pizza by the slice, but Pinocchio’s also has whole pizzas on its menu too, per this CSV file of Sicilian pizzas, &lt;sicilian.csv&gt;, below:\nSicilian Pizza,Small,Large\nCheese,$25.50,$39.95\n1 item,$27.50,$41.95\n2 items,$29.50,$43.95\n3 items,$31.50,$45.95\nSpecial,$33.50,$47.95\n\nSee &lt;regular.csv&gt; for a CSV file of regular pizzas as well.\nOf course, a CSV file isn’t the most customer-friendly format to look at. Prettier might be a table, formatted as ASCII art, like this one:\n+------------------+---------+---------+\n| Sicilian Pizza   | Small   | Large   |\n+==================+=========+=========+\n| Cheese           | $25.50  | $39.95  |\n+------------------+---------+---------+\n| 1 item           | $27.50  | $41.95  |\n+------------------+---------+---------+\n| 2 items          | $29.50  | $43.95  |\n+------------------+---------+---------+\n| 3 items          | $31.50  | $45.95  |\n+------------------+---------+---------+\n| Special          | $33.50  | $47.95  |\n+------------------+---------+---------+\n\nIn a file called pizza.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a CSV file in Pinocchio’s format, and outputs a table formatted as ASCII art using tabulate, a package on PyPI at pypi.org/project/tabulate. Format the table using the library’s grid format. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified file’s name does not end in .csv, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.\n\n\n\nRecall that the csv module comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html, among which are reader, per docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader, and DictReader, per docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader.\nNote that open can raise a FileNotFoundError, per docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError.\nNote that the tabulate package comes with just one function, per pypi.org/project/tabulate. You can install the package with:\npip install tabulate\n\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:\n$\n\nNext execute\nmkdir pizza\n\nto make a folder called pizza in your codespace.\nThen execute\ncd pizza\n\nto change directories into that folder.

Your program should exit using sys.exit and provide an error message:\nToo few command-line arguments\n\nBe sure to download &lt;regular.csv&gt; and &lt;sicilian.csv&gt;, placing them in the same folder as pizza.py.

Run your program with python pizza.py sicilian.txt. Your program should exit using sys.exit and provide an error message:\nNot a CSV file\n\nRun your program with python pizza.py regular.csv.

For instance, whereas a variable for a user’s name might be called name, a variable for a user’s first name might be called firstName, and a variable for a user’s preferred first name (e.g., nickname) might be called preferredFirstName.\nPython, by contrast, recommends snake case, whereby words are instead separated by underscores (_), with all letters in lowercase. For instance, those same variables would be called name, first_name, and preferred_first_name, respectively, in Python.\nIn a file called camel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case.

If it’s not time for a meal, don’t output anything at all. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted in 24-hour time as #:## or ##:##. And assume that each meal’s time range is inclusive.

    "text": "And now for my Wizard tip calculator.\n— Morty Seinfeld\n\nIn the United States, it’s customary to leave a tip for your server after dining in a restaurant, typically an amount equal to 15% or more of your meal’s cost. Not to worry, though, we’ve written a tip calculator for you, below!\ndef main():\n    dollars = dollars_to_float(input(\"How much was the meal? \"))\n    percent = percent_to_float(input(\"What percentage would you like to tip? \"))\n    tip = dollars * percent\n    print(f\"Leave ${tip:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef dollars_to_float(d):\n    # TODO\n\n\ndef percent_to_float(p):\n    # TODO\n\n\nmain()\n\nWell, we’ve written most of a tip calculator for you. Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to implement two functions:\n\ndollars_to_float, which should accept a str as input (formatted as $##.##, wherein each # is a decimal digit), remove the leading $, and return the amount as a float. For instance, given $50.00 as input, it should return 50.0.\npercent_to_float, which should accept a str as input (formatted as ##%, wherein each # is a decimal digit), remove the trailing %, and return the percentage as a float. For instance, given 15% as input, it should return 0.15.\n\nAssume that the user will input values in the expected formats.\n\n\n\nRecall that input returns a str, per docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input.\nRecall that float can convert a str to a float, per docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float.\nRecall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:\n$\n\nNext execute\nmkdir tip\n\nto make a folder called tip in your codespace.\nThen execute\ncd tip\n\nto change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as tip/ $. You can now execute\ncode tip.py\n\nto make a file called tip.py. Copy and paste the code above into a file, and complete the implementations of dollars_to_float and percent_to_float, replacing each TODO with one or more lines of your own code.\n\n\n\nHere’s how to test your code manually:\n\nRun your program with python tip.py. Type $50.00 and press Enter. Then, type 15% and press Enter. Your program should output:\nLeave $7.50    \n\nRun your program with python tip.py. Type $100.00 and press Enter.

    "section": "Global Variables",
    "text": "Global Variables\n\nIn other programming languages, there is the notion of global variables that are accessible to any function.\nWe can leverage this ability within Python. In the text editor window, code as follows:\nbalance = 0\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Balance:\", balance)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how we create a global variable called balance, outside of any function.\nSince no errors are presented by executing the code above, you’d think all is well. However, it is not! In the text editor window, code as follows:\nbalance = 0\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Balance:\", balance)\n    deposit(100)\n    withdraw(50)\n    print(\"Balance:\", balance)\n\n\ndef deposit(n):\n    balance += n\n\n\ndef withdraw(n):\n    balance -= n\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how we now add the functionality to add and withdraw funds to and from balance. However, executing this code, we are presented with an error! We see an error called UnboundLocalError. You might be able to guess that, at least in the way we’ve currently coded balance and our deposit and withdraw functions, we can’t reassign it a new value inside a function.\nTo interact with a global variable inside a function, the solution is to use the global keyword. In the text editor window, code as follows:\nbalance = 0\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Balance:\", balance)\n    deposit(100)\n    withdraw(50)\n    print(\"Balance:\", balance)\n\n\ndef deposit(n):\n    global balance\n    balance += n\n\n\ndef withdraw(n):\n    global balance\n    balance -= n\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how the global keyword tells each function that balance does not refer to a local variable: instead, it refers to the global variable we originally placed at the top of our code. Now, our code functions!\nUtilizing our powers from our experience with object-oriented programming, we can modify our code to use a class instead of a global variable. In the text editor window, code as follows:\nclass Account:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._balance = 0\n\n    @property\n    def balance(self):\n        return self._balance\n\n    def deposit(self, n):\n        self._balance += n\n\n    def withdraw(self, n):\n        self._balance -= n\n\n\ndef main():\n    account = Account()\n    print(\"Balance:\", account.balance)\n    account.deposit(100)\n    account.withdraw(50)\n    print(\"Balance:\", account.balance)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how we use account = Account() to create an account. Classes allow us to solve this issue of needing a global variable more cleanly because these instance variables are accessible to all the methods of this class utilizing self.\nGenerally speaking, global variables should be used quite sparingly, if at all!",

Because we only attempt to print “meow”, not return a value, an error is thrown when we try to store the return value of meow in meows.\nWe can further use type hints to check for errors, this time annotating the return values of functions. In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef meow(n: int) -&gt; None:\n    for _ in range(n):\n        print(\"meow\")\n\n\nnumber: int = int(input(\"Number: \"))\nmeows: str = meow(number)\nprint(meows)\nNotice how the notation -&gt; None tells mypy that there is no return value.\nWe can modify our code to return a string if we wish:\ndef meow(n: int) -&gt; str:\n    return \"meow\\n\" * n\n\n\nnumber: int = int(input(\"Number: \"))\nmeows: str = meow(number)\nprint(meows, end=\"\")\nNotice how we store in meows multiple strs.

An object called parser is created from an ArgumentParser class. That class’s add_argument method is used to tell argparse what arguments we should expect from the user when they run our program. Finally, running the parser’s parse_args method ensures that all of the arguments have been included properly by the user.\nWe can also program more cleanly, such that our user can get some information about the proper usage of our code when they fail to use the program correctly. In the text editor window, code as follows:\nimport argparse\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Meow like a cat\")\nparser.add_argument(\"-n\", help=\"number of times to meow\")\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nfor _ in range(int(args.n)):\n    print(\"meow\")\nNotice how the user is provided some documentation. Specifically, a help argument is provided. Now, if the user executes python meows.py --help or -h, the user will be presented with some clues about how to use this program.\nWe can further improve this program. In the text editor window, code as follows:\nimport argparse\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Meow like a cat\")\nparser.add_argument(\"-n\", default=1, help=\"number of times to meow\", type=int)\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nfor _ in range(args.n):\n    print(\"meow\")\nNotice how not only is help documentation included, but you can provide a default value when no arguments are provided by the user.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of argparse.",

In the text editor window, code as follows:\nfirst, _ = input(\"What's your name? \").split(\" \")\nprint(f\"hello, {first}\")\nNotice how this program tries to get a user’s first name by naively splitting on a single space.\nIt turns out there are other ways to unpack variables. You can write more powerful and elegant code by understanding how to unpack variables in seemingly more advanced ways. In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef total(galleons, sickles, knuts):\n    return (galleons * 17 + sickles) * 29 + knuts\n\n\nprint(total(100, 50, 25), \"Knuts\")\nNotice how this returns the total value of Knuts.\nWhat if we wanted to store our coins in a list? In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef total(galleons, sickles, knuts):\n    return (galleons * 17 + sickles) * 29 + knuts\n\n\ncoins = [100, 50, 25]\n\nprint(total(coins[0], coins[1], coins[2]), \"Knuts\")\nNotice how a list called coins is created. We can pass each value in by indexing using 0, 1, and so on.\nThis is getting quite verbose. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could simply pass the list of coins to our function?\nTo enable the possibility of passing the entire list, we can use unpacking. In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef total(galleons, sickles, knuts):\n    return (galleons * 17 + sickles) * 29 + knuts\n\n\ncoins = [100, 50, 25]\n\nprint(total(*coins), \"Knuts\")\nNotice how a * unpacks the sequence of the list of coins and passes in each of its individual elements to total.\nSuppose that we could pass in the names of the currency in any order? In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef total(galleons, sickles, knuts):\n    return (galleons * 17 + sickles) * 29 + knuts\n\n\nprint(total(galleons=100, sickles=50, knuts=25), \"Knuts\")\nNotice how this still calculates correctly.\nWhen you start talking about “names” and “values,” dictionaries might start coming to mind! You can implement this as a dictionary. In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef total(galleons, sickles, knuts):\n    return (galleons * 17 + sickles) * 29 + knuts\n\n\ncoins = {\"galleons\": 100, \"sickles\": 50, \"knuts\": 25}\n\nprint(total(coins[\"galleons\"], coins[\"sickles\"], coins[\"knuts\"]), \"Knuts\")\nNotice how a dictionary called coins is provided. We can index into it using keys, such as “galleons” or “sickles”.\nSince the total function expects three arguments, we cannot pass in a dictionary. We can use unpacking to help with this. In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef total(galleons, sickles, knuts):\n    return (galleons * 17 + sickles) * 29 + knuts\n\n\ncoins = {\"galleons\": 100, \"sickles\": 50, \"knuts\": 25}\n\nprint(total(**coins), \"Knuts\")\nNotice how ** allows you to unpack a dictionary. When unpacking a dictionary, it provides both the keys and values.",

The uppercase list is printed utilizing the * to unpack it.\nRemoving the brackets, we can pass the words in as arguments. In the text editor window, code as follows:\ndef main():\n    yell(\"This\", \"is\", \"CS50\")\n\n\ndef yell(*words):\n    uppercased = []\n    for word in words:\n        uppercased.append(word.upper())\n    print(*uppercased)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how *words allows for many arguments to be taken by the function.\nmap allows you to map a function to a sequence of values.

First, it takes a function we want applied to every element of a list. Second, it takes that list itself, to which we’ll apply the aforementioned function.

    "text": "Regular Expressions\n\nRegular expressions or “regexes” will enable us to examine patterns within our code. For example, we might want to validate that an email address is formatted correctly. Regular expressions will enable us to examine expressions in this fashion.\nTo begin, type code validate.py in the terminal window. Then, code as follows in the text editor:\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif \"@\" in email:\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that strip will remove whitespace at the beginning or end of the input. Running this program, you will see that as long as an @ symbol is inputted, the program will regard the input as valid.\nYou can imagine, however, that one could input @@ alone and the input could be regarded as valid. We could regard an email address as having at least one @ and a . somewhere within it. Modify your code as follows:\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif \"@\" in email and \".\" in email:\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that while this works as expected, our user could be adversarial, typing simply @. would result in the program returning valid.\nWe can improve the logic of our program as follows:\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nusername, domain = email.split(\"@\")\n\nif username and \".\" in domain:\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice how the strip method is used to determine if username exists and if . is inside the domain variable. Running this program, a standard email address typed in by you could be considered valid. Typing in malan@harvard alone, you’ll find that the program regards this input as invalid.\nWe can be even more precise, modifying our code as follows:\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nusername, domain = email.split(\"@\")\n\nif username and domain.endswith(\".edu\"):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice how the endswith method will check to see if domain contains .edu. Still, however, a nefarious user could still break our code. For example, a user could type in malan@.edu and it would be considered valid.\nIndeed, we could keep iterating upon this code ourselves. However, it turns out that Python has an existing library called re that has a number of built-in functions that can validate user inputs against patterns.\nOne of the most versatile functions within the library re is search.\nThe search function follows the signature re.search(pattern, string, flags=0). Following this signature, we can modify our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(\"@\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice this does not increase the functionality of our program at all. In fact, it is somewhat a step back.\nWe can further our program’s functionality. However, we need to advance our vocabulary around validation. It turns out that in the world of regular expressions there are certain symbols that allow us to identify patterns. At this point, we have only been checking for specific pieces of text like @. It so happens that many special symbols can be passed to the interpreter for the purpose of engaging in validation. A non-exhaustive list of those patterns is as follows:\n.   any character except a new line\n*   0 or more repetitions\n+   1 or more repetitions\n?   0 or 1 repetition\n{m} m repetitions\n{m,n} m-n repetitions\nImplementing this inside of our code, modify yours as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(\".+@.+\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that we don’t care what the username or domain is. What we care about is the pattern. .+ is used to determine if anything is to the left of the email address and if anything is to the right of the email address. Running your code, typing in malan@, you’ll notice that the input is regarded as invalid as we would hope.\nHad we used a regular expression .*@.* in our code above, you can visualize this as follows: \nNotice the depiction of the state machine of our regular expression. On the left, the interpreter begins evaluating the statement from left to right. Once we reach q1 or question 1, the interpreter reads time and time again based on the expression handed to it. Then, the state is changed looking now at q2 or the second question being validated. Again, the arrow indicates how the expression will be evaluated time and time again based upon our programming. Then, as depicted by the double circle, the final state of state machine is reached.\nConsidering the regular expression we used in our code, .+@.+, you can visualize it as follows: \nNotice how q1 is any character provided by the user, including ‘q2’ as 1 or more repetitions of characters. This is followed by the ‘@’ symbol. Then, q3 looks for any character provided by the user, including q4 as 1 or more repetitions of characters.\nThe re and re.search functions and ones like them look for patterns.\nContinuing our improvement of this code, we could improve our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(\".+@.+.edu\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice, however, that one could type in malan@harvard?edu and it could be considered valid. Why is this the case? You might recognize that in the language of validation, a . means any character!\nWe can modify our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\".+@.+\\.edu\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice how we utilize the “escape character” or \\ as a way of regarding the . as part of our string instead of our validation expression. Testing your code, you will notice that malan@harvard.edu is regarded as valid, where malan@harvard?edu is invalid.\nNow that we’re using escape characters, it’s a good time to introduce “raw strings”. In Python, raw strings are strings that don’t format special characters—instead, each character is taken at face-value. Imagine \\n, for example. We’ve seen in an earlier lecture how, in a regular string, these two characters become one: a special newline character. In a raw string, however, \\n is treated not as \\n, the special character, but as a single \\ and a single n. Placing an r in front of a string tells the Python interpreter to treat the string as a raw string, similar to how placing an f in front of a string tells the Python interpreter to treat the string as a format string:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^.+@.+\\.edu$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNow we’ve ensured the Python interpreter won’t treat \\. as a special character. Instead, simply as a \\ followed by a .—which, in regular expression terms, means matching a literal “.”.\nYou can imagine still how our users could create problems for us! For example, you could type in a sentence such as My email address is malan@harvard.edu. and this whole sentence would be considered valid. We can be even more precise in our coding.\nIt just so happens we have more special symbols at our disposal in validation:\n^   matches the start of the string\n$   matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the string\nWe can modify our code using our added vocabulary as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^.+@.+\\.edu$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice this has the effect of looking for this exact pattern matching to the start and end of the expression being validated. Typing in a sentence such as My email address is malan@harvard.edu. now is regarded as invalid.\nWe propose we can do even better! Even though we are now looking for the username at the start of the string, the @ symbol, and the domain name at the end, we could type in as many @ symbols as we wish! malan@@@harvard.edu is considered valid!\nWe can add to our vocabulary as follows:\n[]    set of characters\n[^]   complementing the set\nUsing these newfound abilities, we can modify our expression as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^[^@]+@[^@]+\\.edu$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that ^ means to match at the start of the string. All the way at the end of our expression, $ means to match at the end of the string. [^@]+ means any character except an @. Then, we have a literal @. [^@]+\\.edu means any character except an @ followed by an expression ending in .edu. Typing in malan@@@harvard.edu is now regarded as invalid.\nWe can still improve this regular expression further. It turns out there are certain requirements for what an email address can be! Currently, our validation expression is far too accommodating. We might only want to allow for characters normally used in a sentence. We can modify our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+@[a-zA-Z0-9_]+\\.edu$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that [a-zA-Z0-9_] tells the validation that characters must be between a and z, between A and Z, between 0 and 9 and potentially include an _ symbol. Testing the input, you’ll find that many potential user mistakes can be indicated.\nThankfully, common patterns have been built into regular expressions by hard-working programmers. In this case, you can modify your code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^\\w+@\\w+\\.edu$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that \\w is the same as [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Thanks, hard-working programmers!\nHere are some additional patterns we can add to our vocabulary:\n\\d    decimal digit\n\\D    not a decimal digit\n\\s    whitespace characters\n\\S    not a whitespace character\n\\w    word character, as well as numbers and the underscore\n\\W    not a word character\nNow, we know that there are not simply .edu email addresses. We could modify our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^\\w+@\\w.+\\.(com|edu|gov|net|org)$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice that the | has the impact of an or in our expression.\nAdding even more symbols to our vocabulary, here are some more to consider:\nA|B     either A or B\n(...)   a group\n(?:...) non-capturing version",

    "text": "Case Sensitivity\n\nTo illustrate how you might address issues around case sensitivity, where there is a difference between EDU and edu and the like, let’s rewind our code to the following:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^\\w+@\\w+\\.edu$\", email):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice how we have removed the | statements provided previously.\nRecall that within the re.search function, there is a parameter for flags.\nSome built-in flag variables are:\nre.IGNORECASE\nre.MULTILINE\nre.DOTALL\nConsider how you might use these in your code.\nTherefore, we can change our code as follows.\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^\\w+@\\w+\\.edu$\", email, re.IGNORECASE):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice how we added a third parameter re.IGNORECASE. Running this program with MALAN@HARVARD.EDU, the input is now considered valid.\nConsider the following email address importantProfessor@harper-adams.edu. Using our code above, this would be considered invalid. Why might that be?\nSince there is an additional ., the program considers this invalid.\nIt turns out that we can, looking at our vocabulary from before, we can group together ideas.\nA|B     either A or B\n(...)   a group\n(?:...) non-capturing version\nWe can modify our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nemail = input(\"What's your email? \").strip()\n\nif re.search(r\"^\\w+@(\\w+\\.)?\\w+\\.edu$\", email, re.IGNORECASE):\n    print(\"Valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid\")\nNotice how the (\\w+\\.)? communicates to the interpreter that this new expression can be there once or not at all. Hence, both importantProfessor@harper-adams.edu and importantProfessor@agridat.harper-adams.edu are considered valid.\nInterestingly enough, the edits we have done so far to our code do not fully encompass all the checking that could be done to ensure a valid email address. Indeed, here is the full expression that one would have to type to ensure that a valid email is inputted:\n^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+\\/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$\nThere are other functions within the re library you might find useful. re.match and re.fullmatch are ones you might find exceedingly useful.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of re.",

    "section": "Cleaning Up User Input",
    "text": "Cleaning Up User Input\n\nYou should never expect your users to always follow your hopes for clean input. Indeed, users will often violate your intentions as a programmer.\nThere are ways to clean up your data.\nIn the terminal window, type code format.py. Then, in the text-editor, code as follows:\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice that we have created, essentially, a “hello world” program. Running this program and typing in David, it works well! However, typing in Malan, David notice how the program does not function as intended. How could we modify our program to clean up this input?\nModify your code as follows.\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nif \",\" in name:\n    last, first = name.split(\", \")\n    name = f\"{first} {last}\"\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice how last, first = name.split(\", \") is run if there is a , in the name. Then, the name is standardized as first and last. Running our code, typing in Malan, David, you can see how this program does clean up at least one scenario where a user types in something unexpected.\nYou might notice that typing in Malan,David with no space causes the interpreter to throw an error. Since we now know some regular expression syntax, let’s apply that to our code:\nimport re\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nmatches = re.search(r\"^(.+), (.+)$\", name)\nif matches:\n    last, first = matches.groups()\n    name = first + \" \" + last\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice that re.search can return a set of matches that are extracted from the user’s input. If matches are returned by re.search. Running this program, typing in David Malan notice how the if condition is not run and the name is returned. If you run the program by typing Malan, David, the name is also returned properly.\nIt just so happens that we can request specific groups back using matches.group. We can modify our code as follows:\nimport re\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nmatches = re.search(r\"^(.+), (.+)$\", name)\nif matches:\n    name = matches.group(2) + \" \" + matches.group(1)\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice how, in this implementation, group is not plural (there is no s).\nOur code can be further tightened as follows:\nimport re\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nmatches = re.search(r\"^(.+), (.+)$\", name)\nif matches:\n    name = matches.group(2) + \" \" + matches.group(1)\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice how group(2) and group(1) are concatenated together with a space. The first group is that which is left of the comma. The second group is that which is right of the comma.\nRecognize still that typing in Malan,David with no space will still break our code. Therefore, we can make the following modification:\nimport re\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nmatches = re.search(r\"^(.+), *(.+)$\", name)\nif matches:\n    name = matches.group(2) + \" \" + matches.group(1)\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice the addition of the * in our validation statement. This code will now accept and properly process Malan,David. Further, it will properly handle David,Malanwith many spaces in front ofDavid.\nIt is very common to utilize re.search as we have in the previous examples, where matches is on a line of code after. However, we can combine these statements:\nimport re\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip()\nif matches := re.search(r\"^(.+), *(.+)$\", name):\n    name = matches.group(2) + \" \" + matches.group(1)\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nNotice how we combine two lines of our code. The walrus := operator assigns a value from right to left and allows us to ask a boolean question at the same time. Turn your head sideways and you’ll see why this is called a walrus operator.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of re.",

    "section": "Extracting User Input",
    "text": "Extracting User Input\n\nSo far, we have validated the user’s input and cleaned up the user’s input.\nNow, let’s extract some specific information from user input. In the terminal window, type code twitter.py and code as follows in the text editor window:\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\nprint(url)\nNotice that if we type in https://twitter.com/davidjmalan, it shows exactly what the user typed. However, how would we be able to extract just the username and ignore the rest of the URL?\nYou can imagine how we would simply be able to get rid of the beginning of the standard Twitter URL. We can attempt this as follows:\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nusername = url.replace(\"https://twitter.com/\", \"\")\nprint(f\"Username: {username}\")\nNotice how the replace method allows us to find one item and replace it with another. In this case, we are finding part of the URL and replacing it with nothing. Typing in the full URL https://twitter.com/davidjmalan, the program effectively outputs the username. However, what are some shortcomings of this current program?\nWhat if the user simply typed twitter.com instead of including the https:// and the like? You can imagine many scenarios where the user may input or neglect to input parts of the URL that would create strange output by this program. To improve this program, we can code as follows:\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nusername = url.removeprefix(\"https://twitter.com/\")\nprint(f\"Username: {username}\")\nNotice how we utilize the removeprefix method. This method will remove the beginning of a string.\nRegular expressions simply allow us to succinctly express the patterns and goals.\nWithin the re library, there is a method called sub. This method allows us to substitute a pattern with something else.\nThe signature of the sub method is as follows\nre.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)\nNotice how pattern refers to the regular expression we are looking for. Then, there is a repl string that we can replace the pattern with. Finally, there is the string that we want to do the substitution on.\nImplementing this method in our code, we can modify our program as follows:\nimport re\n\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nusername = re.sub(r\"https://twitter.com/\", \"\", url)\nprint(f\"Username: {username}\")\nNotice how executing this program and inputting https://twitter.com/davidjmalan produces the correct outcome. However, there are some problems still present in our code.\nThe protocol, subdomain, and the possibility that the user inputted any part of the URL after the username are all reasons that this code is still not ideal. We can further address these shortcomings as follows:\nimport re\n\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nusername = re.sub(r\"^(https?://)?(www\\.)?twitter\\.com/\", \"\", url)\nprint(f\"Username: {username}\")\nNotice how the ^ caret was added to the url. Notice also how the . could be interpreted improperly by the interpreter. Therefore, we escape it using a \\ to make it \\. For the purpose of tolerating both http and https, we add a ? to the end of https?, making the s optional. Further, to accommodate www we add (www\\.)? to our code. Finally, just in case the user decides to leave out the protocol altogether, the http:// or https:// is made optional using (https?://).\nStill, we are blindly expecting that what the user inputted a url that, indeed, has a username.\nUsing our knowledge of re.search, we can further improve our code.\nimport re\n\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nmatches = re.search(r\"^https?://(www\\.)?twitter\\.com/(.+)$\", url, re.IGNORECASE)\nif matches:\n    print(f\"Username:\", matches.group(2))\nNotice how we are searching for the regular expression above in the string provided by the user. In particular, we are capturing that which appears at the end of the URL using (.+)$ regular expression. Therefore, if the user fails to input a URL without a username, no input will be presented.\nEven further tightening up our program, we can utilize our := operator as follows:\nimport re\n\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nif matches := re.search(r\"^https?://(?:www\\.)?twitter\\.com/(.+)$\", url, re.IGNORECASE):\n    print(f\"Username:\", matches.group(1))\nNotice that the ?: tells the interpreter it does not have to capture what is in that spot in our regular expression.\nStill, we can be more explicit to ensure that the username inputted is correct. Using Twitter’s documentation, we can add the following to our regular expression:\nimport re\n\nurl = input(\"URL: \").strip()\n\nif matches := re.search(r\"^https?://(?:www\\.)?twitter\\.com/([a-z0-9_]+)\", url, re.IGNORECASE):\n    print(f\"Username:\", matches.group(1))\nNotice that the [a-z0-9_]+ tells the interpreter to only expect a-z, 0-9, and _ as part of the regular expression. The + indicates that we are expecting one or more characters.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of re.",

In the text editor, make sure that your code appears as follows:\ndef main():\n    x = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\n    print(\"x squared is\", square(x))\n\n\ndef square(n):\n    return n * n\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that you could plausibly test the above code on your own using some obvious numbers such as 2.

Testing frameworks like pytest will run each function, even if there was a failure in one of them. Re-running pytest test_calculator.py, you will notice that many more errors are being displayed. More error output allows you to further explore what might be producing the problems within your code.\nHaving improved our test code, return your calculator.py code to fully working order:\ndef main():\n    x = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\n    print(\"x squared is\", square(x))\n\n\ndef square(n):\n    return n * n\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that we have changed the + operator to a * in the square function, returning it to a working state.\nRe-running pytest test_calculator.py, you will notice that no errors are found.\nFinally, we can test that our program handles exceptions.

Code as follows in your text editor:\nx = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\nprint(f\"x is {x}\")\nNotice that by including the f, we tell Python to interpolate what is in the curly braces as the value of x. Further, testing out your code, you can imagine how one could easily type in a string or a character instead of a number. Even still, a user could type nothing at all – simply hitting the enter key.\nAs programmers, we should be defensive to ensure that our users are entering what we expected.\nIf we run this program and type “cat”, we’ll see ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'cat'. In other words, the int function cannot convert the text “cat” into a number.\nAn effective strategy to fix this potential error would be to create “error handling” to ensure the user behaves as we intend.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of Errors and Exceptions.",

Notice how logically elif x == y is not a necessary evaluation to run. After all, if logically x is not less than y AND x is not greater than y, x MUST equal y. Therefore, we don’t have to run elif x == y. We can create a “catch-all,” default outcome using an else statement.

Adjust your code as follows:\ndef main():\n    x = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\n    if is_even(x):\n        print(\"Even\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Odd\")\n\n\ndef is_even(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n\nmain()\nNotice that our if statement is_even(x) works even though there is no operator there. This is because our function returns a bool (Boolean), True or False, back to the main function. The if statement simply evaluates whether or not is_even of x is true or false.",

    "text": "Pythonic\n\nIn the programming world, there are types of programming that are called “Pythonic” in nature. That is, there are ways to program that are sometimes only seen in Python programming. Consider the following revision to our program:\ndef main():\n    x = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\n    if is_even(x):\n        print(\"Even\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Odd\")\n\n\ndef is_even(n):\n    return True if n % 2 == 0 else False\n\n\nmain()\nNotice that this return statement in our code is almost like a sentence in English. This is a unique way of coding only seen in Python.\nWe can further revise our code and make it more and more readable:\ndef main():\n    x = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\n    if is_even(x):\n        print(\"Even\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Odd\")\n\n\ndef is_even(n):\n    return n % 2 == 0\n\n\nmain()\nNotice that the program will evaluate what is happening within the n % 2 == 0 as either True or False and simply return that to the main function.",

    "section": "match",
    "text": "match\n\nSimilar to if, elif, and else statements, match statements can be used to conditionally run code that matches certain values.\nConsider the following program:\n  name = input(\"What's your name? \")\n\n  if name == \"Harry\":\n      print(\"Gryffindor\")\n  elif name == \"Hermione\":\n      print(\"Gryffindor\")\n  elif name == \"Ron\": \n      print(\"Gryffindor\")\n  elif name == \"Draco\":\n      print(\"Slytherin\")\n  else:\n      print(\"Who?\")\nNotice the first three conditional statements print the same response.\nWe can improve this code slightly with the use of the or keyword:\n  name = input(\"What's your name? \")\n\n  if name == \"Harry\" or name == \"Hermione\" or name == \"Ron\": \n      print(\"Gryffindor\")\n  elif name == \"Draco\":\n      print(\"Slytherin\")\n  else:\n      print(\"Who?\")\nNotice the number of elif statements has decreased, improving the readability of our code.\nAlternatively, we can use match statements to map names to houses. Consider the following code:\n  name = input(\"What's your name? \")\n\n  match name: \n      case \"Harry\":\n          print(\"Gryffindor\")\n      case \"Hermione\":\n          print(\"Gryffindor\")\n      case \"Ron\": \n          print(\"Gryffindor\")\n      case \"Draco\":\n          print(\"Slytherin\")\n      case _:\n          print(\"Who?\")\nNotice the use of the _ symbol in the last case. This will match with any input, resulting in similar behavior as an else statement.\nA match statement compares the value following the match keyword with each of the values following the case keywords. In the event a match is found, the respective indented code section is executed, and the program stops the matching.\nWe can improve the code:\n  name = input(\"What's your name? \")\n\n  match name: \n      case \"Harry\" | \"Hermione\" | \"Ron\":\n          print(\"Gryffindor\")\n      case \"Draco\":\n          print(\"Slytherin\")\n      case _:\n          print(\"Who?\")\nNotice, the use of the single vertical bar |. Much like the or keyword, this allows us to check for multiple values in the same case statement.",

As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the course staff, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, let’s talk about it. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, share it and let’s discuss. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo some of the optional readings, read and share relevant Twitter/X posts, read and share relevant Hacker News articles. Consider joining or forming a reading group that meets once per week to discuss.\nDo the homework and the tutorials. The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions.

This is a famous canonical program that nearly all coders write during their learning process.\nIn the terminal window, you can execute commands. To run this program, you are going to need to move your cursor to the bottom of the screen, clicking in the terminal window. You can now type a second command in the terminal window. Next to the dollar sign, type python hello.py and press the enter key on your keyboard.\nRecall that computers really only understand zeros and ones. Therefore, when you run python hello.py, Python will interpret the text that you created in hello.py and translate it into the zeros and ones that the computer can understand.\nThe result of running the python hello.py program is hello, world.\nCongrats!

    "text": "Improving Your First Python Program\n\nWe can personalize your first Python program.\nIn our text editor in hello.py we can add another function. input is a function that takes a prompt as an argument. We can edit our code to say\ninput(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"hello, world\")\nThis edit alone, however, will not allow your program to output what your user inputs. For that, we will need to introduce you to variables\n\n\nVariables\n\nA variable is just a container for a value within your own program.\nIn your program, you can introduce your own variable in your program by editing it to read\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"hello, world\")\nNotice that this equal = sign in the middle of name = input(\"What's your name? \") has a special role in programming. This equal sign literally assigns what is on the right to what is on the left. Therefore, the value returned by input(\"What's your name? \") is assigned to name.\nIf you edit your code as follows, you will notice an unexpected result:\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"hello, name\")\nThe program will return hello, name in the terminal window regardless of what the user types.\nFurther editing our code, you could type\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"hello,\")\nprint(name)\nThe result in the terminal window would be\nWhat's your name? Ed\nhello\nEd\nWe are getting closer to the result we might intend!\nYou can learn more in the Python documentation on data types.\n\n\n\nComments\n\nComments are a way for programmers to track what they are doing in their programs and even inform others about their intentions for a block of code. In short, they are notes for yourself and others who will see your code!\nYou can add comments to your program to be able to see what it is that your program is doing. You might edit your code as follows:\n# Ask the user for their name\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"hello,\")\nprint(name)\nComments can also serve as a to-do list for you.\n\n\n\nPseudocode\n\nPseudocode is an important type of comment that becomes a special type of to-do list, especially when you don’t understand how to accomplish a coding task. For example, in your code, you might edit your code to say:\n# Ask the user for their name\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\n\n# Print hello\nprint(\"hello,\")\n\n# Print the name inputted\nprint(name)",

    "text": "Strings and Parameters\n\nA string, known as a str in Python, is a sequence of text.\nRewinding a bit in our code back to the following, there was a visual side effect of having the result appear on multiple lines:\n# Ask the user for their name\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"hello,\")\nprint(name)\nFunctions take arguments that influence their behavior. If we look at the documentation for print you’ll notice we can learn a lot about the arguments that the print function takes.\nLooking at this documentation, you’ll learn that the print function automatically includes the argument end='\\n'. This \\n indicates that the print function will automatically create a line break when run. The function takes an argument called end, and the default is to create a new line.\nHowever, we can technically provide an argument for end ourselves such that a new line is not created!\nWe can modify our code as follows:\n# Ask the user for their name\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(\"hello,\", end=\"\")\nprint(name)\nBy providing end=\"\" we are overwriting the default value of end such that it never creates a new line after this first print statement. Providing the name as “David”, the output in the terminal window will be hello, David.\nParameters, therefore, are arguments that can be taken by a function.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation on print.\n\n\nA small problem with quotation marks\n\nNotice how adding quotation marks as part of your string is challenging.\nprint(\"hello,\"friend\"\") will not work, and the interpreter will throw an error.\nGenerally, there are two approaches to fixing this. First, you could simply change the quotes to single quotation marks.\nAnother, more commonly used approach would be to write print(\"hello, \\\"friend\\\"\"). The backslashes tell the interpreter that the following character should be treated as a quotation mark in the string and avoid an interpreter error.",

Therefore, you will need to ensure that the input of your user is corrected or checked.\nIt turns out that built into strings is the ability to remove whitespace from a string.\nBy utilizing the strip method on name (for example, name = name.strip()), you will remove any whitespace from the left and right of the user’s input. You can modify your code to be:\n# Ask the user for their name\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\n\n# Remove whitespace from the str\nname = name.strip()\n\n# Print the output\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nRerunning this program, regardless of how many spaces you type before or after the name, it will strip off all the whitespace.\nUsing the title method, it would title case the user’s name:\n# Ask the user for their name\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\n\n# Remove whitespace from the str\nname = name.strip()\n\n# Capitalize the first letter of each word\nname = name.title()\n\n# Print the output\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nBy this point, you might be very tired of typing python repeatedly in the terminal window.

Why might this be?\nPrior, we have seen how the + sign concatenates two strings. Because your input from your keyboard on your computer comes into the interpreter as text, it is treated as a string. We, therefore, need to convert this input from a string to an integer. We can do so as follows:\nx = input(\"What's x? \")\ny = input(\"What's y? \")\n\nz = int(x) + int(y)\n\nprint(z)\nThe result is now correct. The use of int(x) is called “casting,” where a value is temporarily changed from one type of variable (in this case, a string) to another (here, an integer).\nWe can further improve our program as follows:\nx = int(input(\"What's x? \"))\ny = int(input(\"What's y? \"))\n\nprint(x + y)\nThis illustrates that you can run functions on functions. The inner function is run first, and then the outer one is run. First, the input function is run. Then, the int function.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of int.",

Looking at the Python documentation for round, you’ll see that the available arguments are round(number[, ndigits]). Those square brackets indicate that something optional can be specified by the programmer. Therefore, you could do round(n) to round a digit to its nearest integer. Alternatively, you could code as follows:\n# Get the user's input\nx = float(input(\"What's x? \"))\ny = float(input(\"What's y? \"))\n\n# Create a rounded result\nz = round(x + y)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(z)\nThe output will be rounded to the nearest integer.\nWhat if we wanted to format the output of long numbers?

    "text": "Def\n\nWouldn’t it be nice to create our own functions?\nLet’s bring back our final code of hello.py by typing code hello.py into the terminal window. Your starting code should look as follows:\n# Ask the user for their name, remove whitespace from the str and capitalize the first letter of each word\nname = input(\"What's your name? \").strip().title()\n\n# Print the output\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\nWe can better our code to create our own special function that says “hello” for us!\nErasing all our code in our text editor, let’s start from scratch:\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nhello()\nprint(name)\nAttempting to run this code, your interpreter will throw an error. After all, there is no defined function for hello.\nWe can create our own function called hello as follows:\ndef hello():\n    print(\"hello\")\n\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nhello()\nprint(name)\nNotice that everything under def hello() is indented. Python is an indented language. It uses indentation to understand what is part of the above function. Therefore, everything in the hello function must be indented. When something is not indented, it treats it as if it is not inside the hello function. Running python hello.py in the terminal window, you’ll see that your output is not exactly as you may want.\nWe can further improve our code:\n# Create our own function\ndef hello(to):\n    print(\"hello,\", to)\n\n\n# Output using our own function\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nhello(name)\nHere, in the first lines, you are creating your hello function. This time, however, you are telling the interpreter that this function takes a single parameter: a variable called to. Therefore, when you call hello(name) the computer passes name into the hello function as to. This is how we pass values into functions. Very useful! Running python hello.py in the terminal window, you’ll see that the output is much closer to our ideal presented earlier in this lecture.\nWe can change our code to add a default value to hello:\n# Create our own function\ndef hello(to=\"world\"):\n    print(\"hello,\", to)\n\n\n# Output using our own function\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nhello(name)\n\n# Output without passing the expected arguments\nhello()\nTest out your code yourself. Notice how the first hello will behave as you might expect, and the second hello, which is not passed a value, will, by default, output hello, world.\nWe don’t have to have our function at the start of our program. We can move it down, but we need to tell the interpreter that we have a main function and a separate hello function.\ndef main():\n\n    # Output using our own function\n    name = input(\"What's your name? \")\n    hello(name)\n\n    # Output without passing the expected arguments\n    hello()\n\n\n# Create our own function\ndef hello(to=\"world\"):\n    print(\"hello,\", to)\nThis alone, however, will create an error of sorts. If we run python hello.py, nothing happens! The reason for this is that nothing in this code is actually calling the main function and bringing our program to life.\nThe following very small modification will call the main function and restore our program to working order:\ndef main():\n\n    # Output using our own function\n    name = input(\"What's your name? \")\n    hello(name)\n\n    # Output without passing the expected arguments\n    hello()\n\n\n# Create our own function\ndef hello(to=\"world\"):\n    print(\"hello,\", to)\n\n\nmain()",

    "text": "While Loops\n\nThe while loop is nearly universal throughout all coding languages.\nSuch a loop will repeat a block of code over and over again.\nIn the text editor window, edit your code as follows:\ni = 3\nwhile i != 0:\n    print(\"meow\")\nNotice how even though this code will execute print(\"meow\") multiple times, it will never stop! It will loop forever. while loops work by repeatedly asking if the condition of the loop has been fulfilled. In this case, the interpreter is asking, “does i not equal zero?” When you get stuck in a loop that executes forever, you can press Ctrl+C on your keyboard to break out of the loop.\nTo fix this loop that lasts forever, we can edit our code as follows\ni = 3\nwhile i != 0:\n  print(\"meow\")\n  i = i - 1\nNotice that now our code executes properly, reducing i by 1 for each “iteration” through the loop. The term iteration has special significance within coding. By iteration, we mean one cycle through the loop. The first iteration is the “0th” iteration through the loop. The second is the “1st” iteration. In programming, we count starting with 0, then 1, then 2.\nWe can further improve our code as follows:\n  i = 1\n  while i &lt;= 3:\n      print(\"meow\")\n      i = i + 1\nNotice that when we code i = i + 1 we assign the value of i from the right to the left. Above, we are starting i at one, like most humans count (1, 2, 3). If you execute the code above, you’ll see it meows three times. It’s best practice in programming to begin counting with zero.\nWe can improve our code to start counting with zero:\ni = 0\nwhile i &lt; 3:\n    print(\"meow\")\n    i += 1\nNotice how changing the operator to i &lt; 3 allows our code to function as intended. We begin by counting with 0 and it iterates through our loop three times, producing three meows. Also, notice how i += 1 is the same as saying i = i + 1.\nOur code at this point is illustrated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    flowchart TD\n      A([start]) --&gt; B[i = 0]\n      B --&gt; C{i &lt; 3}\n      C -- True --&gt; D[\"#quot;meow#quot;\"]\n      D --&gt; E[i += 1]\n      E --&gt; C\n      C -- False --&gt; F([stop])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how our loop counts i up to, but not through `3`.",

    "section": "For Loops",
    "text": "For Loops\n\nA for loop is a different type of loop.\nTo best understand a for loop, it’s best to begin by talking about a new variable type called a list in Python. As in other areas of our lives, we can have a grocery list, a to-do list, etc.\nA for loop iterates through a list of items. For example, in the text editor window, modify your cat.py code as follows:\nfor i in [0, 1, 2]:\n    print(\"meow\")\nNotice how clean this code is compared to your previous while loop code. In this code, i begins with 0, meows, i is assigned 1, meows, and, finally, i is assigned 2, meows, and then ends.\nWhile this code accomplishes what we want, there are some possibilities for improving our code for extreme cases. At first glance, our code looks great. However, what if you wanted to iterate up to a million? It’s best to create code that can work with such extreme cases. Accordingly, we can improve our code as follows:\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(\"meow\")\nNotice how range(3) provides back three values (0, 1, and 2) automatically. This code will execute and produce the intended effect, meowing three times.\nOur code can be further improved. Notice how we never use i explicitly in our code. That is, while Python needs the i as a place to store the number of the iteration of the loop, we never use it for any other purpose. In Python, if such a variable does not have any other significance in our code, we can simply represent this variable as a single underscore _. Therefore, you can modify your code as follows:\nfor _ in range(3):\n    print(\"meow\")\nNotice how changing the i to _ has zero impact on the functioning of our program.\nOur code can be further improved. To stretch your mind to the possibilities within Python, consider the following code:\nprint(\"meow\" * 3)\nNotice how it will meow three times, but the program will produce meowmeowmeow as the result. Consider: How could you create a line break at the end of each meow?\nIndeed, you can edit your code as follows:\nprint(\"meow\\n\" * 3, end=\"\")\nNotice how this code produces three meows, each on a separate line. By adding end=\"\" and the \\n we tell the interpreter to add a line break at the end of each meow.",

    "text": "Improving with User Input\n\nPerhaps we want to get input from our user. We can use loops as a way of validating the input of the user.\nA common paradigm within Python is to use a while loop to validate the input of the user.\nFor example, let’s try prompting the user for a number greater than or equal to 0:\nwhile True:\n    n = int(input(\"What's n? \"))\n    if n &lt; 0:\n        continue\n    else:\n        break\nNotice that we’ve introduced two new keywords in Python, continue and break. continue explicitly tells Python to go to the next iteration of a loop. break, on the other hand, tells Python to “break out” of a loop early before it has finished all of its iterations. In this case, we’ll continue to the next iteration of the loop when n is less than 0—ultimately reprompting the user with “What’s n?”. If, though, n is greater than or equal to 0, we’ll break out of the loop and allow the rest of our program to run.\nIt turns out that the continue keyword is redundant in this case. We can improve our code as follows:\nwhile True:\n    n = int(input(\"What's n? \"))\n    if n &gt; 0:\n        break\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    print(\"meow\")\nNotice how this while loop will always run (forever) until n is greater than 0. When n is greater than 0, the loop breaks.\nBringing in our prior learning, we can use functions to further improve our code:\ndef main():\n    meow(get_number())\n\n\ndef get_number():\n    while True:\n        n = int(input(\"What's n? \"))\n        if n &gt; 0:\n            return n\n\n\ndef meow(n):\n    for _ in range(n):\n        print(\"meow\")\n\n\nmain()\nNotice how not only did we change your code to operate in multiple functions, but we also used a return statement to return the value of n back to the main function.",

Modify your code as follows:\ndef main():\n    print_row(4)\n\n\ndef print_row(width):\n    print(\"?\" * width)\n\n\nmain()\nNotice how we now have code that can create left-to-right blocks.\nExamining the slide below, notice how Mario has both rows and columns of blocks.\n\n\n\nMario Underground.\n\n\nConsider: How could we implement both rows and columns within our code?

You can use the word import in your program.\nInside the random module, there is a built-in function called random.choice(seq). random is the module you are importing. Inside that module, there is the choice function. That function takes into it a seq or sequence that is a list.\nIn your terminal window type code generate.py. In your text editor, code as follows:\nimport random\n\ncoin = random.choice([\"heads\", \"tails\"])\nprint(coin)\nNotice that the list within choice has square braces, quotes, and a comma. Since you have passed in two items, Python does the math and gives a 50% chance for heads and tails. Running your code, you will notice that this code, indeed, does function well!\nWe can improve our code. from allows us to be very specific about what we’d like to import. Prior, our import line of code is bringing the entire contents of the functions of random. However, what if we want to only load a small part of a module? Modify your code as follows:\nfrom random import choice\n\ncoin = choice([\"heads\", \"tails\"])\nprint(coin)\nNotice that we now can import just the choice function of random. From that point forward, we no longer need to code random.choice. We can now only code choice alone. choice is loaded explicitly into our program. This saves system resources and potentially can make our code run faster!\nMoving on, consider the function random.randint(a, b). This function will generate a random number between a and b. Modify your code as follows:\nimport random\n\nnumber = random.randint(1, 10)\nprint(number)\nNotice that our code will randomly generate a number between 1 and 10.\nWe can introduce the function random.shuffle(x), which shuffles a list into a random order.\nimport random\n\ncards = [\"jack\", \"queen\", \"king\"]\nrandom.shuffle(cards)\nfor card in cards:\n    print(card)\nNotice that random.shuffle will shuffle the cards in place. Unlike other functions, it will not return a value. Instead, it will take the cards list and shuffle them inside that list. Run your code a few times to see the code functioning.\nWe now have these three ways above to generate random information.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of random.",

In the terminal window, type code name.py. In the text editor, code as follows:\nimport sys\n\nprint(\"hello, my name is\", sys.argv[1])\nNotice that the program is going to look at what the user typed in the command line. Currently, if you type python name.py David into the terminal window, you will see hello, my name is David. Notice that sys.argv[1] is where David is being stored. Why is that? Well, in prior lessons, you might remember that lists start at the 0th element. What do you think is held currently in sys.argv[0]? If you guessed name.py, you would be correct!\nThere is a small problem with our program as it stands. What if the user does not type in the name at the command line? Try it yourself. Type python name.py into the terminal window. An error list index out of range will be presented by the interpreter. The reason for this is that there is nothing at sys.argv[1] because nothing was typed! Here’s how we can protect our program from this type of error:\nimport sys\n\ntry:\n    print(\"hello, my name is\", sys.argv[1])\nexcept IndexError:\n    print(\"Too few arguments\")\nNotice that the user will now be prompted with a useful hint about how to make the program work if they forget to type in a name. However, could we be more defensive to ensure the user inputs the right values?\nOur program can be improved as follows:\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:\n    print(\"Too few arguments\")\nelif len(sys.argv) &gt; 2:\n    print(\"Too many arguments\")\nelse:\n    print(\"hello, my name is\", sys.argv[1])\nNotice how if you test your code, you will see how these exceptions are handled, providing the user with more refined advice. Even if the user types in too many or too few arguments, the user is provided clear instructions about how to fix the issue.\nRight now, our code is logically correct. However, there is something very nice about keeping our error checking separate from the remainder of our code. How could we separate out our error handling? Modify your code as follows:\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:\n    sys.exit(\"Too few arguments\")\nelif len(sys.argv) &gt; 2:\n    sys.exit(\"Too many arguments\")\n\nprint(\"hello, my name is\", sys.argv[1])\nNotice how we are using a built-in function of sys called exit that allows us to exit the program if an error was introduced by the user. We can rest assured now that the program will never execute the final line of code and trigger an error. Therefore, sys.argv provides a way by which users can introduce information from the command line. sys.exit provides a means by which the program can exit if an error arises.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of sys.",

In your internet browser, you can visit https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=1&term=weezer and a text file will be downloaded. This URL was constructed by reading Apple’s API documentation. Notice how this query is looking for a song, with a limit of one result, that relates to the term called weezer. Looking at this text file that is downloaded, you might find the format to be similar to that we’ve programmed previously in Python.\nThe format in the downloaded text file is called JSON, a text-based format that is used to exchange text-based data between applications. Literally, Apple is providing a JSON file that we could interpret in our own Python program.\nIn the terminal window, type code itunes.py. Code as follows:\nimport requests\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 2:\n    sys.exit()\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=1&term=\" + sys.argv[1])\nprint(response.json())\nNotice how the returned value of requests.get will be stored in response. Having read the Apple documentation about this API, you’d know that what is returned is a JSON file. Running python itunes.py weezer, you will see the JSON file returned by Apple. However, the JSON response is converted by Python into a dictionary. Looking at the output, it can be quite dizzying!\nIt turns out that Python has a built-in JSON library that can help us interpret the data received. Modify your code as follows:\nimport json\nimport requests\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 2:\n    sys.exit()\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=1&term=\" + sys.argv[1])\nprint(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))\nNotice that json.dumps is implemented such that it utilizes indent to make the output more readable. Running python itunes.py weezer, you will see the same JSON file. However, this time, it is much more readable. Notice now that you will see a dictionary called results inside the output. Inside that dictionary called results there are numerous keys present. Look at the trackName value in the output. What track name do you see in your results?\nHow could we simply output the name of just that track name? Modify your code as follows:\nimport json\nimport requests\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 2:\n    sys.exit()\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=50&term=\" + sys.argv[1])\n\no = response.json()\nfor result in o[\"results\"]:\n    print(result[\"trackName\"])\nNotice how we are taking the result of response.json() and storing it in o (as in the lowercase letter). Then, we are iterating through the results in o and printing each trackName. Also notice how we have increased the limit number of results to 50. Run your program. See the results.\nYou can learn more about requests through the library’s documentation.\nYou can learn more about JSON in Python’s documentation of JSON.",

You can modify your code as follows:\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, house = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        students.append(f\"{name} is in {house}\")\n\nfor student in sorted(students):\n    print(student)\nNotice that we create a list called students. We append each string to this list. Then, we output a sorted version of our list.\nRecall that Python allows for dictionaries where a key can be associated with a value. This code could be further improved\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, house = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        student = {}\n        student[\"name\"] = name\n        student[\"house\"] = house\n        students.append(student)\n\nfor student in students:\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}\")\nNotice that we create an empty dictionary called student. We add the values for each student, including their name and house into the student dictionary. Then, we append that student to the list called students.\nWe can improve our code to illustrate this as follows:\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, house = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        student = {\"name\": name, \"house\": house}\n        students.append(student)\n\nfor student in students:\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}\")\nNotice that this produces the desired outcome, minus the sorting of students.\nUnfortunately, we cannot sort the students as we had prior because each student is now a dictionary inside of a list. It would be helpful if Python could sort the students list of student dictionaries that sorts this list of dictionaries by the student’s name.\nTo implement this in our code, make the following changes:\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, house = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        students.append({\"name\": name, \"house\": house})\n\n\ndef get_name(student):\n    return student[\"name\"]\n\n\nfor student in sorted(students, key=get_name):\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}\")\nNotice that sorted needs to know how to get the key of each student. Python allows for a parameter called key where we can define on what “key” the list of students will be sorted. Therefore, the get_name function simply returns the key of student[\"name\"]. Running this program, you will now see that the list is now sorted by name.\nStill, our code can be further improved upon. It just so happens that if you are only going to use a function like get_name once, you can simplify your code in the manner presented below. Modify your code as follows:\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, house = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        students.append({\"name\": name, \"house\": house})\n\nfor student in sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[\"name\"]):\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is in {student['house']}\")\nNotice how we use a lambda function, an anonymous function, that says “Hey Python, here is a function that has no name: Given a student, access their name and return that to the key.\nUnfortunately, our code is a bit fragile. Suppose that we changed our CSV file such that we indicated where each student grew up. What would be the impact of this upon our program? First, modify your students.csv file as follows:\n\nHarry,\"Number Four, Privet Drive\"\nRon,The Burrow\nDraco,Malfoy Manor\nNotice how running our program how will produce a number of errors.\n\nNow that we’re dealing with homes instead of houses, modify your code as follows:\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, home = line.rstrip().split(\",\")\n        students.append({\"name\": name, \"home\": home})\n\nfor student in sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[\"name\"]):\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is in {student['home']}\")\nNotice that running our program still does not work properly. Can you guess why?\nThe ValueError: too many values to unpack error produced by the interpreter is a result of the fact that we previously created this program expecting the CSV file is split using a , (comma). We could spend more time addressing this, but indeed someone else has already developed a way to “parse” (that is, to read) CSV files!\nPython’s built-in csv library comes with an object called a reader. As the name suggests, we can use a reader to read our CSV file despite the extra comma in “Number Four, Privet Drive”. A reader works in a for loop, where each iteration the reader gives us another row from our CSV file. This row itself is a list, where each value in the list corresponds to an element in that row. row[0], for example, is the first element of the given row, while row[1] is the second element.\nimport csv\n\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    reader = csv.reader(file)\n    for row in reader:\n        students.append({\"name\": row[0], \"home\": row[1]})\n\nfor student in sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[\"name\"]):\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is from {student['home']}\")\nNotice that our program now works as expected.\nUp until this point, we have been relying upon our program to specifically decide what parts of our CSV file are the names and what parts are the homes. It’s better design, though, to bake this directly into our CSV file by editing it as follows:\nname,home\nHarry,\"Number Four, Privet Drive\"\nRon,The Burrow\nDraco,Malfoy Manor\nNotice how we are explicitly saying in our CSV file that anything reading it should expect there to be a name value and a home value in each line.\nWe can modify our code to use a part of the csv library called a DictReader to treat our CSV file with even more flexibilty:\nimport csv\n\nstudents = []\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\") as file:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n    for row in reader:\n        students.append({\"name\": row[\"name\"], \"home\": row[\"home\"]})\n\nfor student in sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[\"name\"]):\n    print(f\"{student['name']} is in {student['home']}\")\nNotice that we have replaced reader with DictReader, which returns one dictionary at a time. Also, notice that the interpreter will directly access the row dictionary, getting the name and home of each student. This is an example of coding defensively. As long as the person designing the CSV file has inputted the correct header information on the first line, we can access that information using our program.\nUp until this point, we have been reading CSV files. What if we want to write to a CSV file?\nTo begin, let’s clean up our files a bit. First, delete the students.csv file by typing rm students.csv in the terminal window. This command will only work if you’re in the same folder as your students.csv file.\nThen, in students.py, modify your code as follows:\nimport csv\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nhome = input(\"Where's your home? \")\n\nwith open(\"students.csv\", \"a\") as file:\n    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=[\"name\", \"home\"])\n    writer.writerow({\"name\": name, \"home\": home})\nNotice how we are leveraging the built-in functionality of DictWriter, which takes two parameters: the file being written to and the fieldnames to write. Further, notice how the writerow function takes a dictionary as its parameter. Quite literally, we are telling the interpreter to write a row with two fields called name and home.\nNote that there are many types of files that you can read from and write to.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of CSV.",

This type of file can store anything including, music and image data.\nThere is a popular Python library called PIL that works well with image files.\nAnimated GIFs are a popular type of image file that has many image files within it that are played in sequence over and over again, creating a simplistic animation or video effect.\nImagine that we have a series of costumes, as illustrated below.\nHere is costume1.gif.\n\n\n\n\nCat number 1.\n\n\n\nHere is another one called costume2.gif. Notice how the leg positions are slightly different.\n\n\n\n\nCat number 2.\n\n\n\nBefore proceeding, please make sure that you have downloaded the source code files from the course website. It will not be possible for you to code the following without having the two images above in your possession and stored in your IDE.\nIn the terminal window type code costumes.py and code as follows:\nimport sys\n\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nimages = []\n\nfor arg in sys.argv[1:]:\n    image = Image.open(arg)\n    images.append(image)\n\nimages[0].save(\n    \"costumes.gif\", save_all=True, append_images=[images[1]], duration=200, loop=0\n)\nNotice that we import the Image functionality from PIL. Notice that the first for loop simply loops through the images provided as command-line arguments and stores theme into the list called images. The 1: starts slicing argv at its second element. The last lines of code saves the first image and also appends a second image to it as well, creating an animated gif. Typing python costumes.py costume1.gif costume2.gif into the terminal. Now, type code costumes.gif into the terminal window, and you can now see an animated GIF.\nYou can learn more in Pillow’s documentation of PIL.",

    "section": "Object-Oriented Programming",
    "text": "Object-Oriented Programming\n\nThere are different paradigms of programming. As you learn other languages, you will start recognizing patterns like these.\nUp until this point, you have worked procedurally step-by-step.\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is a compelling solution to programming-related problems.\nTo begin, type code student.py in the terminal window and code as follows:\nname = input(\"Name: \")\nhouse = input(\"House: \")\nprint(f\"{name} from {house}\")\nNotice that this program follows a procedural, step-by-step paradigm: Much like you have seen in prior parts of this course.\nDrawing on our work from previous weeks, we can create functions to abstract away parts of this program.\ndef main():\n    name = get_name()\n    house = get_house()\n    print(f\"{name} from {house}\")\n\n\ndef get_name():\n    return input(\"Name: \")\n\n\ndef get_house():\n    return input(\"House: \")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how get_name and get_house abstract away some of the needs of our main function. Further, notice how the final lines of the code above tell the interpreter to run the main function.\nWe can further simplify our program by storing the student as a tuple. A tuple is a sequence of values. Unlike a list, a tuple can’t be modified. In spirit, we are returning two values.\ndef main():\n    name, house = get_student()\n    print(f\"{name} from {house}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return name, house\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how get_student returns name, house.\nPacking that tuple, such that we are able to return both items to a variable called student, we can modify our code as follows.\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(f\"{student[0]} from {student[1]}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return (name, house)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that (name, house) explicitly tells anyone reading our code that we are returning two values within one. Further, notice how we can index into tuples using student[0] or student[1].\ntuples are immutable, meaning we cannot change those values. Immutability is a way by which we can program defensively.\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    if student[0] == \"Padma\":\n        student[1] = \"Ravenclaw\"\n    print(f\"{student[0]} from {student[1]}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return name, house\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that this code produces an error. Since tuples are immutable, we’re not able to reassign the value of student[1].\nIf we wanted to provide our fellow programmers flexibility, we could utilize a list as follows.\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    if student[0] == \"Padma\":\n        student[1] = \"Ravenclaw\"\n    print(f\"{student[0]} from {student[1]}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return [name, house]\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNote that lists are mutable. That is, the order of house and name can be switched by a programmer. You might decide to utilize this in some cases where you want to provide more flexibility at the cost of the security of your code. After all, if the order of those values is changeable, programmers that work with you could make mistakes down the road.\nA dictionary could also be utilized in this implementation. Recall that dictionaries provide a key-value pair.\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(f\"{student['name']} from {student['house']}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    student = {}\n    student[\"name\"] = input(\"Name: \")\n    student[\"house\"] = input(\"House: \")\n    return student\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice in this case, two key-value pairs are returned. An advantage of this approach is that we can index into this dictionary using the keys.\nStill, our code can be further improved. Notice that there is an unneeded variable. We can remove student = {} because we don’t need to create an empty dictionary.\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(f\"{student['name']} from {student['house']}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return {\"name\": name, \"house\": house}\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice we can utilize {} braces in the return statement to create the dictionary and return it all in the same line.\nWe can provide our special case with Padma in our dictionary version of our code.\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    if student[\"name\"] == \"Padma\":\n        student[\"house\"] = \"Ravenclaw\"\n    print(f\"{student['name']} from {student['house']}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return {\"name\": name, \"house\": house}\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how, similar in spirit to our previous iterations of this code, we can utilize the key names to index into our student dictionary.",

Further, notice the ... simply means that we will later return to finish that portion of our code. Further, notice that in get_student, we can create a student of class Student using the syntax student = Student(). Further, notice that we utilize “dot notation” to access attributes of this variable student of class Student.\nAny time you create a class and you utilize that blueprint to create something, you create what is called an “object” or an “instance”. In the case of our code, student is an object.\nFurther, we can lay some groundwork for the attributes that are expected inside an object whose class is Student. We can modify our code as follows:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house):\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(f\"{student.name} from {student.house}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    student = Student(name, house)\n    return student\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that within Student, we standardize the attributes of this class. We can create a function within class Student, called a “method”, that determines the behavior of an object of class Student. Within this function, it takes the name and house passed to it and assigns these variables to this object. Further, notice how the constructor student = Student(name, house) calls this function within the Student class and creates a student. self refers to the current object that was just created.\nWe can simplify our code as follows:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house):\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(f\"{student.name} from {student.house}\")\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return Student(name, house)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how return Student(name, house) simplifies the previous iteration of our code where the constructor statement was run on its own line.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of classes.",

It turns out we can create our own exceptions that alerts the programmer to a potential error created by the user called raise. In the case above, we raise ValueError with a specific error message.\nIt just so happens that Python allows you to create a specific function by which you can print the attributes of an object. Modify your code as follows:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house, patronus):\n        if not name:\n            raise ValueError(\"Missing name\")\n        if house not in [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid house\")\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n        self.patronus = patronus\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} from {self.house}\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(student)\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    patronus = input(\"Patronus: \")\n    return Student(name, house, patronus)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how def __str__(self) provides a means by which a student is returned when called. Therefore, you can now, as the programmer, print an object, its attributes, or almost anything you desire related to that object.\n__str__ is a built-in method that comes with Python classes. It just so happens that we can create our own methods for a class as well! Modify your code as follows:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house, patronus=None):\n        if not name:\n            raise ValueError(\"Missing name\")\n        if house not in [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid house\")\n        if patronus and patronus not in [\"Stag\", \"Otter\", \"Jack Russell terrier\"]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid patronus\")\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n        self.patronus = patronus\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} from {self.house}\"\n\n    def charm(self):\n        match self.patronus:\n            case \"Stag\":\n                return \"🐴\"\n            case \"Otter\":\n                return \"🦦\"\n            case \"Jack Russell terrier\":\n                return \"🐶\"\n            case _:\n                return \"🪄\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(\"Expecto Patronum!\")\n    print(student.charm())\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    patronus = input(\"Patronus: \") or None\n    return Student(name, house, patronus)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how we define our own method charm. Unlike dictionaries, classes can have built-in functions called methods. In this case, we define our charm method where specific cases have specific results. Further, notice that Python has the ability to utilize emojis directly in our code.\nBefore moving forward, let us remove our patronus code.

Doing so defines house as a property of our class. With house as a property, we gain the ability to define how some attribute of our class, _house, should be set and retrieved. Indeed, we can now define a function called a “setter”, via @house.setter, which will be called whenever the house property is set—for example, with student.house = \"Gryffindor\". Here, we’ve made our setter validate values of house for us. Notice how we raise a ValueError if the value of house is not any of the Harry Potter houses, otherwise, we’ll use house to update the value of _house. Why _house and not house? house is a property of our class, with functions via which a user attempts to set our class attribute. _house is that class attribute itself. The leading underscore, _, indicates to users they need not (and indeed, shouldn’t!) modify this value directly. _house should only be set through the house setter. Notice how the house property simply returns that value of _house, our class attribute that has presumably been validated using our house setter. When a user calls student.house, they’re getting the value of _house through our house “getter”.\nIn addition to the name of the house, we can protect the name of our student as well. Modify your code as follows:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house):\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} from {self.house}\"\n\n    # Getter for name\n    @property\n    def name(self):\n        return self._name\n\n    # Setter for name\n    @name.setter\n    def name(self, name):\n        if not name:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid name\")\n        self._name = name\n\n    @property\n    def house(self):\n        return self._house\n\n    @house.setter\n    def house(self, house):\n        if house not in [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid house\")\n        self._house = house\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = get_student()\n    print(student)\n\n\ndef get_student():\n    name = input(\"Name: \")\n    house = input(\"House: \")\n    return Student(name, house)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice how, much like the previous code, we provide a getter and setter for the name.\nYou can learn more in Python’s documentation of methods.",

    "text": "Class Methods\n\nSometimes, we want to add functionality to a class itself, not to instances of that class.\n@classmethod is a function that we can use to add functionality to a class as a whole.\nHere’s an example of not using a class method. In your terminal window, type code hat.py and code as follows:\nimport random\n\n\nclass Hat:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.houses = [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"]\n\n    def sort(self, name):\n        print(name, \"is in\", random.choice(self.houses))\n\n\nhat = Hat()\nhat.sort(\"Harry\")\nNotice how when we pass the name of the student to the sorting hat, it will tell us what house is assigned to the student. Notice that hat = Hat() instantiates a hat. The sort functionality is always handled by the instance of the class Hat. By executing hat.sort(\"Harry\"), we pass the name of the student to the sort method of the particular instance of Hat, which we’ve called hat.\nWe may want, though, to run the sort function without creating a particular instance of the sorting hat (there’s only one, after all!). We can modify our code as follows:\nimport random\n\n\nclass Hat:\n\n    houses = [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"]\n\n    @classmethod\n    def sort(cls, name):\n        print(name, \"is in\", random.choice(cls.houses))\n\n\nHat.sort(\"Harry\")\nNotice how the __init__ method is removed because we don’t need to instantiate a hat anywhere in our code. self, therefore, is no longer relevant and is removed. We specify this sort as a @classmethod, replacing self with cls. Finally, notice how Hat is capitalized by convention near the end of this code, because this is the name of our class.\nReturning back to students.py we can modify our code as follows, addressing some missed opportunities related to @classmethods:\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, house):\n        self.name = name\n        self.house = house\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} from {self.house}\"\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get(cls):\n        name = input(\"Name: \")\n        house = input(\"House: \")\n        return cls(name, house)\n\n\ndef main():\n    student = Student.get()\n    print(student)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\nNotice that get_student is removed and a @classmethod called get is created. This method can now be called without having to create a student first.",

Dates in that format can’t be easily sorted because the date’s year comes last instead of first. Try sorting, for instance, 2/2/1800, 3/3/1900, and 1/1/2000 chronologically in any program (e.g., a spreadsheet). Dates in that format are also ambiguous. Harvard was founded on September 8, 1636, but 9/8/1636 could also be interpreted as August 9, 1636!\nFortunately, computers tend to use ISO 8601, an international standard that prescribes that dates should be formatted in year-month-day (YYYY-MM-DD) order, no matter the country, formatting years with four digits, months with two digits, and days with two digits, “padding” each with leading zeroes as needed.\nIn a file called outdated.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a date, anno Domini, in month-day-year order, formatted like 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636, wherein the month in the latter might be any of the values in the list below:\n[\n    \"January\",\n    \"February\",\n    \"March\",\n    \"April\",\n    \"May\",\n    \"June\",\n    \"July\",\n    \"August\",\n    \"September\",\n    \"October\",\n    \"November\",\n    \"December\"\n]\n\nThen output that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the user’s input is not a valid date in either format, prompt the user again. Assume that every month has no more than 31 days; no need to validate whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.\n\n\n\nRecall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods, including split.\nRecall that a list comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists, among which is index.\nNote that you can format an int with leading zeroes with code like\nprint(f\"{n:02}\")\n\nwherein, if n is a single digit, it will be prefixed with one 0, per docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax.\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window.

For instance, if the toy were to display 4 + 0 = , David would (hopefully) answer with 4. If the toy were to display 4 + 1 = , David would (hopefully) answer with 5. If David were to answer incorrectly, the toy would display EEE. And after three incorrect answers for the same problem, the toy would simply display the correct answer (e.g., 4 + 0 = 4 or 4 + 1 = 5).\nIn a file called professor.py, implement a program that:\n\nPrompts the user for a level, (n). If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.\nRandomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with (n) digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).\n\nNote: The order in which you generate x and y matters. Your program should generate random numbers in x, y pairs to simulate generating one math question at a time (e.g., x0 with y0, x1 with y1, and so on).\n\nPrompts the user to solve each of those problems. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.\nThe program should ultimately output the user’s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.\n\nStructure your program as follows, wherein get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts) the user for a level and returns 1, 2, or 3, and generate_integer returns a single randomly generated non-negative integer with level digits or raises a ValueError if level is not 1, 2, or 3:\nimport random\n\n\ndef main():\n    ...\n\n\ndef get_level():\n    ...\n\n\ndef generate_integer(level):\n    ...\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n\n\n\nNote that you can raise an exception like ValueError with code like:\nraise ValueError\n\nNote that the random module comes with quite a few functions, per docs.python.org/3/library/random.html. Of particular interest, perhaps, are the functions specialized for returning integers, such as randint and randrange.\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window.

    "text": "One way to measure the complexity of a program is to count its number of lines of code (LOC), excluding blank lines and comments. For instance, a program like\n# Say hello\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\n\nhas just two lines of code, not four, since its first line is a comment, and its second line is blank (i.e., just whitespace). That’s not that many, so odds are the program isn’t that complex. Of course, just because a program (or even function) has more lines of code than another doesn’t necessarily mean it’s more complex. For instance, a function like\ndef is_even(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nisn’t really twice as complex as a function like\ndef is_even(n):\n    return n % 2 == 0\n\neven though the former has (more than) twice as many lines of code. In fact, the former might arguably be simpler if it’s easier to read! So lines of code should be taken with a grain of salt.\nEven so, in a file called lines.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file, excluding comments and blank lines. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified file’s name does not end in .py, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.\nAssume that any line that starts with #, optionally preceded by whitespace, is a comment. (A docstring should not be considered a comment.) Assume that any line that only contains whitespace is blank.\n\n\n\nRecall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods, including lstrip and startswith.\nNote that open can raise a FileNotFoundError, per docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError.\nYou might find it helpful to test your program on, e.g., some of Week 6’s source code as well as on programs of your own.\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window.

You can now execute\ncode lines.py\n\nto make a file called lines.py where you’ll write your program.\n\n\n\nHere’s how to test your code manually:\n\nRun your program with python lines.py.

But each # should be a number between 0 and 255, inclusive. Suffice it to say 275 is not in that range! If only NUMB3RS had validated the address in that scene!\nIn a file called numb3rs.py, implement a function called validate that expects an IPv4 address as input as a str and then returns True or False, respectively, if that input is a valid IPv4 address or not.\nStructure numb3rs.py as follows, wherein you’re welcome to modify main and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not import any other libraries.

    "text": "Cookie Monster\n\n\nSource: Sesame Street\nSuppose that you’d like to implement a cookie jar in which to store cookies. In a file called jar.py, implement a class called Jar with these methods:\n\n__init__ should initialize a cookie jar with the given capacity, which represents the maximum number of cookies that can fit in the cookie jar. If capacity is not a non-negative int, though, __init__ should instead raise a ValueError.\n__str__ should return a str with (n) 🍪, where (n) is the number of cookies in the cookie jar. For instance, if there are 3 cookies in the cookie jar, then str should return \"🍪🍪🍪\"\ndeposit should add n cookies to the cookie jar. If adding that many would exceed the cookie jar’s capacity, though, deposit should instead raise a ValueError.\nwithdraw should remove n cookies from the cookie jar. Nom nom nom. If there aren’t that many cookies in the cookie jar, though, withdraw should instead raise a ValueError.\ncapacity should return the cookie jar’s capacity.\nsize should return the number of cookies actually in the cookie jar, initially 0.\n\nStructure your class per the below. You may not alter these methods’ parameters, but you may add your own methods.\nclass Jar:\n    def __init__(self, capacity=12):\n        ...\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        ...\n\n    def deposit(self, n):\n        ...\n\n    def withdraw(self, n):\n        ...\n\n    @property\n    def capacity(self):\n        ...\n\n    @property\n    def size(self):\n        ...\n\nEither before or after you implement jar.py, additionally implement, in a file called test_jar.py, four or more functions that collectively test your implementation of Jar thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:\npytest test_jar.py\n\nNote that it’s not as easy to test instance methods as it is to test functions alone, since instance methods sometimes manipulate the same “state” (i.e., instance variables). To test one method (e.g., withdraw), then, you might need to call another method first (e.g., deposit). But the method you call first might itself not be correct!\nAnd so programmers sometimes mock (i.e., simulate) state when testing methods, as with Python’s own mock object library, so that you can call just the one method but modify the underlying state first, without calling the other method to do so.\nFor simplicity, though, no need to mock any state.
