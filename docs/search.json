    "text": "Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes\nFive hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear\nFive hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes\nHow do you measure, measure a year?\n— “Seasons of Love,” Rent\n\nAssuming there are 365 days in a year, there are (365 = 525,600) minutes in that same year (because there are 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour). But how many minutes are there in two or more years? Well, it depends on how many of those are leap years with 366 days, per the Gregorian calendar, as some of them could have (1 = 1,440) additional minutes. In fact, how many minutes has it been since you were born? Well, that, too, depends on how many leap years there have been since! There is an algorithm for such, but let’s not reinvent that wheel. Let’s use a library instead. Fortunately, Python comes with a datetime module that has a class called date that can help, per docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#date-objects.\nIn a file called seasons.py, implement a program that prompts the user for their date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format and then sings prints how old they are in minutes, rounded to the nearest integer, using English words instead of numerals, just like the song from Rent, without any and between words. Since a user might not know the time at which they were born, assume, for simplicity, that the user was born at midnight (i.e., 00:00:00) on that date. And assume that the current time is also midnight. In other words, even if the user runs the program at noon, assume that it’s actually midnight, on the same date. Use datetime.date.today to get today’s date, per docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.today.\nStructure your program per the below, not only with a main function but also with one or more other functions as well:\nfrom datetime import date\n\n\ndef main():\n    ...\n\n\n...\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nYou’re welcome to import other (built-in) libraries, or any that are specified in the below hints. Exit via sys.exit if the user does not input a date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Ensure that your program will not raise any exceptions.\nEither before or after you implement seasons.py, additionally implement, in a file called test_seasons.py, one or more functions that test your implementation of any functions besides main in seasons.py thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:\npytest test_seasons.py\n\n\n\n\nNote that the date class comes with quite a few methods and “supported operations,” per docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#date-objects. In particular, the class implements __sub__, per docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.__sub__, overloading - in such a way that subtracting one date object from another returns a timedelta object, which itself comes with several (read-only) “instance attributes,” per docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects.\nNote that the inflect module comes with quite a few methods, per pypi.org/project/inflect. You can install it with:\npip install inflect\n\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:\n$\n\nNext execute\nmkdir seasons\n\nto make a folder called seasons in your codespace.\nThen execute\ncd seasons\n\nto change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as seasons/ $. You can now execute\ncode seasons.py\n\nto make a file called seasons.py where you’ll write your program. Be sure to also execute\ncode test_seasons.py\n\nto create a file called test_seasons.py where you’ll write tests for your program.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how to test seasons.py manually:\n\nRun your program with python seasons.py. Ensure your program prompts you for a birthdate. Type a date one year ago from today, in the specified format, then press Enter. Your program should sing print Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes. If this is a leap year, there should be one more day’s worth of minutes, so expect Five hundred twenty-seven thousand forty minutes instead!\nRun your program with python seasons.py. Type a date two years ago from today, in the specified format, then press Enter. Your program should print One million, fifty-one thousand, two hundred minutes (or One million, fifty-two thousand, six hundred forty minutes in a leap year).\nRun your program with python seasons.py. Type a date of your choice, but this time use an invalid format. Press Enter and your program should exit using sys.exit without raising an Exception.\n\n\n\n\nTo test your tests, run pytest test_seasons.py. Try to use correct and incorrect versions of seasons.py to determine how well your tests spot errors:\n\nEnsure you have a correct version of seasons.py. Run your tests by executing pytest test_seasons.py. pytest should show that all of your tests have passed.\nModify one of the functions you’ve implemented in seasons.py and imported into test_seasons.py. One of your functions might, for example, fail to raise a ValueError when it should. Run your tests by executing pytest test_seasons.py. pytest should show that at least one of your tests has failed.\nContinue to modify the behavior of seasons.py, creating (predictably) incorrect versions of your implementation. Run your tests by executing pytest test_seasons.py. Do the tests you expect to fail, fail?"

    "text": "A famous place for pizza in Harvard Square is Pinocchio’s Pizza & Subs, aka Noch’s, known for its Sicilian pizza, which is “a deep-dish or thick-crust pizza.”\nStudents on the university campus tend to buy pizza by the slice, but Pinocchio’s also has whole pizzas on its menu too, per this CSV file of Sicilian pizzas, &lt;sicilian.csv&gt;, below:\nSicilian Pizza,Small,Large\nCheese,$25.50,$39.95\n1 item,$27.50,$41.95\n2 items,$29.50,$43.95\n3 items,$31.50,$45.95\nSpecial,$33.50,$47.95\n\nSee &lt;regular.csv&gt; for a CSV file of regular pizzas as well.\nOf course, a CSV file isn’t the most customer-friendly format to look at. Prettier might be a table, formatted as ASCII art, like this one:\n+------------------+---------+---------+\n| Sicilian Pizza   | Small   | Large   |\n+==================+=========+=========+\n| Cheese           | $25.50  | $39.95  |\n+------------------+---------+---------+\n| 1 item           | $27.50  | $41.95  |\n+------------------+---------+---------+\n| 2 items          | $29.50  | $43.95  |\n+------------------+---------+---------+\n| 3 items          | $31.50  | $45.95  |\n+------------------+---------+---------+\n| Special          | $33.50  | $47.95  |\n+------------------+---------+---------+\n\nIn a file called pizza.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a CSV file in Pinocchio’s format, and outputs a table formatted as ASCII art using tabulate, a package on PyPI at pypi.org/project/tabulate. Format the table using the library’s grid format. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified file’s name does not end in .csv, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.\n\n\n\nRecall that the csv module comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html, among which are reader, per docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader, and DictReader, per docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader.\nNote that open can raise a FileNotFoundError, per docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError.\nNote that the tabulate package comes with just one function, per pypi.org/project/tabulate. You can install the package with:\npip install tabulate\n\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:\n$\n\nNext execute\nmkdir pizza\n\nto make a folder called pizza in your codespace.\nThen execute\ncd pizza\n\nto change directories into that folder.

For instance, whereas a variable for a user’s name might be called name, a variable for a user’s first name might be called firstName, and a variable for a user’s preferred first name (e.g., nickname) might be called preferredFirstName.\nPython, by contrast, recommends snake case, whereby words are instead separated by underscores (_), with all letters in lowercase. For instance, those same variables would be called name, first_name, and preferred_first_name, respectively, in Python.\nIn a file called camel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case.

If it’s not time for a meal, don’t output anything at all. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted in 24-hour time as #:## or ##:##. And assume that each meal’s time range is inclusive.

    "text": "And now for my Wizard tip calculator.\n— Morty Seinfeld\n\nIn the United States, it’s customary to leave a tip for your server after dining in a restaurant, typically an amount equal to 15% or more of your meal’s cost. Not to worry, though, we’ve written a tip calculator for you, below!\ndef main():\n    dollars = dollars_to_float(input(\"How much was the meal? \"))\n    percent = percent_to_float(input(\"What percentage would you like to tip? \"))\n    tip = dollars * percent\n    print(f\"Leave ${tip:.2f}\")\n\n\ndef dollars_to_float(d):\n    # TODO\n\n\ndef percent_to_float(p):\n    # TODO\n\n\nmain()\n\nWell, we’ve written most of a tip calculator for you. Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to implement two functions:\n\ndollars_to_float, which should accept a str as input (formatted as $##.##, wherein each # is a decimal digit), remove the leading $, and return the amount as a float. For instance, given $50.00 as input, it should return 50.0.\npercent_to_float, which should accept a str as input (formatted as ##%, wherein each # is a decimal digit), remove the trailing %, and return the percentage as a float. For instance, given 15% as input, it should return 0.15.\n\nAssume that the user will input values in the expected formats.\n\n\n\nRecall that input returns a str, per docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input.\nRecall that float can convert a str to a float, per docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float.\nRecall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:\n$\n\nNext execute\nmkdir tip\n\nto make a folder called tip in your codespace.\nThen execute\ncd tip\n\nto change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as tip/ $. You can now execute\ncode tip.py\n\nto make a file called tip.py. Copy and paste the code above into a file, and complete the implementations of dollars_to_float and percent_to_float, replacing each TODO with one or more lines of your own code.\n\n\n\nHere’s how to test your code manually:\n\nRun your program with python tip.py. Type $50.00 and press Enter. Then, type 15% and press Enter. Your program should output:\nLeave $7.50    \n\nRun your program with python tip.py. Type $100.00 and press Enter. Then, type 18% and press Enter. Your program should output:\nLeave $18.00\n\nRun your program with python tip.py. Type $15.00 and press Enter. Then, type 25% and press Enter. Your program should output\nLeave $3.75"

    "text": "Micro-quotes: “Even seasoned developers can find UI design tough, and generative AI tools help tremendously.” “AI tools provide a big boost for developers who aren’t great at UI.” “First, we need to build a great prompt for this.” “7.1 Getting our strategy from our AI tools Before we approach these tools, we should think carefully about our prompt.” “If we say “generate a frontend for my application” without enough information, the guidance will be too vague.” “There is a time and a place for brief prompts.”\n\n\n\nThis week switches focus from backend logic to the part users actually touch: the user interface (UI). The aim is to use chat-based generative AI (especially ChatGPT) as a pair designer + pair developer to:\n\npropose a UI strategy (pages around 179–181)\nwrite structured prompts that produce targeted UI guidance and code\nconvert wireframes and flows into Flask templates + components\nadd responsive HTML/CSS elements without being a frontend expert\n\nThis week is very workflow heavy: it is less “what is a transformer?” and more “how do we get from backend routes to a usable application screen?”\n\n\n\nWe will use these week-specific ideas repeatedly:\n\nWireframe — a sketch (boxes + labels) of what the UI should contain and roughly how it should be laid out.\nFlask templates — HTML files rendered by Flask (often using Jinja2), letting you combine content + layout + Python variables.\nJinja2 — the templating language Flask uses to inject variables/loops/conditionals into HTML.\nResponsive design — designing pages so they work on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).\nPrompt scaffolding — structuring a prompt into sections (objective, constraints, inputs, outputs) so the AI returns usable results.\n\n\n\n\nThese are images embedded in the PDF pages for Week 07. Not all are equally useful (some are icons/background elements), but they are extracted and downloadable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA key idea early in this week: do strategy first, then code second. The point is that you can waste a lot of time prompting for code before you have agreed what the UI is supposed to do and feel like.\n\n\n\nIf you ask for “a frontend” without specifics, the AI returns generic boilerplate.\nStrategy prompts help you decide: pages, navigation, user flow, components, and naming.\nYou get a UI that matches your backend data model instead of fighting it later.\n\n\n\n\nThis week demonstrates writing a prompt with explicit blocks:\n\nRole (who the AI should act as)\nObjective (what the UI needs to achieve)\nContext (what already exists: backend routes, DB, etc.)\nConstraints (Flask templates, mobile-friendly, accessible)\nDeliverables (pages list, wireframe descriptions, template structure, CSS suggestions)\n\n\n“If we say”generate a frontend for my application” without enough information, the guidance will be too vague.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a “prompt builder” approach: you store prompt sections as strings and assemble them.

The challenge is making pages dynamic.\nThis week expects you to connect templates to Flask route variables.\nIn Jinja2 you often loop over data: quizzes, questions, or results.\nAI can generate the loop structure quickly, but you must match variable names to your actual Python.\nAlways confirm: what does the route pass into the template?\n\n\n\nAs your UI grows, duplication becomes the enemy.\nIn Flask/Jinja, you can create a base template and extend it.\nThis week’s workflow benefits from: a base layout, then child pages.\nAI can scaffold a base.html with blocks (content, scripts).\nPitfall: students forget to keep blocks consistent and pages break silently.\n\n\n\nWeek 07 is not a testing week, but UI work still needs verification.\nAt minimum: confirm routes render, form submissions work, and nav links don’t 404.\nAI can help generate checklists for manual testing.\nIf you have time, write a tiny smoke test using Flask’s test client.\n\n\n\nThis matches this week’s theme of converting backend data into pages.\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n{% block content %}\n&lt;h1&gt;Available quizzes&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  {% for quiz in quizzes %}\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/quiz/{{ quiz.id }}\"&gt;{{ quiz.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  {% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n{% endblock %}\n\n\n\nbody { max-width: 960px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1rem; }\nnav a { margin-right: 1rem; }\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  body { padding: 0.5rem; }\n  nav a { display: block; margin: 0.25rem 0; }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWeek 07 uses ChatGPT to move from “backend works” to “users can actually use it”.\nThe skill is not magic HTML generation: it’s prompt scaffolding + iteration.\nWireframes + flows keep AI output grounded.\nFlask templates + Jinja2 are the bridge between Python data and the UI.\nResponsive design is essential: test on multiple screen sizes early.\n\n\n\n\n\nI can write a “strategy prompt” before asking for UI code.\nI can list UI screens for a Flask app and map navigation between them.\nI can scaffold templates/static folders for a maintainable frontend.\nI can implement a base template + child templates with Jinja2 blocks.\nI can add basic responsive CSS and verify it in a browser.",

Summary\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPrompting is not “asking nicely”. In the real world, you use prompts to specify behaviour under constraints:\n\nyou want repeatable outputs\nyou want outputs that are checkable\nyou want the model to use the right information\nyou want it to behave sensibly when information is missing\n\nA useful mindset: a prompt is closer to a function signature than a conversation.\n\n\n\n“A prompt is a program in natural language.”\n\n\n\n\nExplain the task (what success looks like)\nConstrain the output (how the response must be shaped)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA practical prompt usually contains these parts (not always in this order):\n\nRole: “You are a …” (useful when behaviour matters)\nGoal: what to produce\nContext: what the model should know or assume\nInputs: what you are providing (data, text, code, constraints)\nRules: explicit do/don’t constraints\nOutput format: JSON, Markdown, table, bullet list, etc\nQuality bar: rubric / checklist / tests\n\n\n\n\nRole prompting: framing the model’s perspective and responsibilities.\nConstraints: explicit limits that prevent unwanted behaviour or formats.\nFew-shot prompting: teaching by giving examples of desired input→output.\nRubric: a checklist the model should satisfy.\nOutput schema: a formal structure the output must follow (e.g., JSON).\n\n\n\n\nBad (vague):\nWrite a good explanation of SQL joins.\nBetter (engineered):\nYou are a first-year teaching assistant.\nExplain SQL joins to beginners using:\n- exactly 3 join types (INNER, LEFT, FULL)\n- one simple table example\n- one common mistake per join type\nOutput as markdown with headings and a final summary.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost student prompts fail because they skip specification. You can convert vague intent into a usable prompt by answering:\n\nWhat is the deliverable? (an explanation / a plan / code / critique)\nWho is the audience?\nWhat constraints exist? (length, style, tools, time)\nWhat does success look like? (rubric / checklist)\nWhat should never happen?

Was it ambiguous? Was it missing?\nThen modify the prompt so the failure becomes impossible or unlikely.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "“Vibe coding” is a workflow, not a magic trick.\n\nThese notes follow Week 10 and show how Cursor changes the way you write software, why it works, and the pitfalls that catch beginners.\n\n\nWeek 10 moves from “coding with AI as a helper” to a conversational programming workflow where your editor + model become a co-author.\nYou’ll see:\n\nHow Cursor differs from “just ChatGPT in a browser”\nWhat vibe coding means in practice (and what it does not mean)\nHow to prompt for a whole working program and then iterate safely\nHow to use Cursor’s modes (chat, edit, autocomplete) deliberately\nHow to keep control: debugging, tests, and small edits instead of chaos\n\nReal-world framing: this is the difference between “asking AI questions” and shipping software with AI in the loop.\n\n\n\n\n“At one end of the spectrum…”\n\nThe phrase “vibe coding” is basically: you steer by intent and feedback, not by writing every line from scratch.\n\n\n\nYou start by describing behavior (what the program should do) rather than implementation (how it does it).\nThe AI proposes code.\nYou run it, observe, and then refine the prompt (or apply edits) until it behaves.\n\nThat feedback loop is the “vibe”.\n\n\n\n\nLLMs are strong at first drafts and pattern-matching.\nEditors like Cursor provide context (your whole repo), so the model can be more precise.\nYou can move faster when you accept that drafts are disposable.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot “no thinking”.\nNot “trust the model blindly”.\nNot “skip debugging”.\n\nIf you do that, you get brittle code and mysterious failures.\n\n\n\n\nOver-scoping: asking for “build the whole app” without constraints.\nUnder-specifying: vague goals produce vague programs.\nContext leakage: if your project contains confusing files, the model can copy the wrong patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this figure to remember the mental model:\n\nDescribe intent\n\nGenerate a draft\n\nRun it\n\nDebug + refine\n\nRepeat until correct\n\n\n\n\n\n“What is Cursor, and why is it different?”\n\nCursor is an IDE designed to make AI part of the editing loop. The big difference is context + actions:\n\nIt sees your open files, selections, and (optionally) the entire project.\nIt can apply edits directly (not just suggest them).\nIt supports modes that match real programming tasks.\n\nIn other words, it’s not “chatting about code” — it’s editing code with chat.\n\n\n\nYou can ask for changes in-place (e.g., “refactor this function”).\nYou can request multi-file modifications (e.g., “add a new module + tests”).\nYou can iterate with smaller deltas, which makes reviewing easier.\n\n\n\n\n\nCursor can make too many edits if your prompt is broad.\nAlways review diffs like you would a teammate PR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA typical Cursor workspace gives you:\n\nEditor: where the truth lives (the code you run)\nChat panel: ask for explanations, changes, scaffolding\nInline suggestions: “autocomplete on steroids”\nCommand palette actions: apply or rewrite sections quickly\n\nTeaching point: students must learn that the editor is the source of truth — not the chat transcript.\n\n\n\n\n“Project-wide context…”\n\nCursor becomes powerful when it understands your project:\n\nFolder structure\nDependencies\nNaming conventions\n“How we do things here”\n\nThis is where good software engineering meets AI.\n\n\nEven with Cursor, models still have limited context windows.

Pygame? terminal?)\nconstraints (keep it simple, one file)\nexpected behavior (controls, win condition)\noutput format (code only, plus run instructions)\n\n\n\nYou are an expert Python developer.\n\nBuild a simple Pong-style game in Python using pygame.\n\nConstraints:\n- Single file: game.py\n- Keep it beginner friendly (clear functions, comments)\n- WASD controls for left paddle, arrow keys for right paddle\n- Score displayed at top\n- Press Q to quit\n\nOutput:\n- Provide the complete code for game.py\n- Then provide exact run steps (pip + python)\n\n\n\n\nIt creates a format contract: the model knows what to output.\nIt defines inputs (controls), outputs (score), and stop condition (quit).\nIt sets the difficulty level (beginner friendly).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Cursor basics”\n\nCursor gives you multiple ways to use AI, and mixing them up causes pain.\n\n\nUse for:\n\ndesign discussion (“what approach should we take?”)\ndebugging (“here’s the stack trace, what does it mean?”)\nplanning (“break this into steps”)\n\n\n\n\nUse for:\n\ntargeted rewrites (“simplify this function”)\ntransformations (“convert to dataclass”)\nlocal refactors (“rename variables consistently”)\n\n\n\n\nUse for:\n\nwriting boilerplate quickly\nfinishing predictable patterns\nstaying in flow\n\nTeaching tip: chat is best when you don’t know what to do, edit is best when you know what you want changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Giving feedback”\n\nFeedback is the steering wheel of vibe coding.\nGood feedback is:\n\nspecific (“the paddle is moving too fast”)\ntestable (“ball should bounce at the same angle”)\nconstrained (“only change movement speed constants”)\n\nBad feedback is:\n\nemotional (“this is broken”)\nvague (“make it better”)\n\n\n\n\nWhat did I expect?\nWhat happened instead?\nWhere in the code does that behavior live?\nWhat is the smallest change that could fix it?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe temptation is to paste everything.

This project is split into two main components: a pitch presentation and the final project creation. In the pitch presentation, reminiscent of a ‘Dragon’s Den’ scenario, groups of students are expected to conceive and present an innovative application of large language models (LLMs) and APIs. This presentation should detail the objectives, technology use (such as vector databases and OpenAI API), methodology, and potential impact of the proposed project. Following the pitch, students collaborate to turn their concept into a reality. This phase involves prompt engineering, crafting efficient data processing systems, and ultimately producing a functional prototype or application that aligns with their initial pitch. The project is assessed on its functionality, innovation, effective use of data science technologies, and overall execution.",

The module staff and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the course staff, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, let’s talk about it. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, share it and let’s discuss. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo some of the optional readings, read and share relevant Twitter/X posts, read and share relevant Hacker News articles. Consider joining or forming a reading group that meets once per week to discuss.\nDo the homework and the tutorials. The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, ask for help, and let us help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

    "text": "“…use your existing Python expertise alongside AI that understands your code context…”\n\n\n\n\n“Supercharge your coding with AI” “No AI expertise is required.” -Some AI Bro\n\nIn this week we introduce generative AI as a practical toolset for real software development. The goal is not to turn you into an ML creator. The goal is to help you build code solutions, with less busywork, and fewer defects.\n\n\n\nA working definition of generative AI in the context of programming work.\nA map of the developer tool landscape (general chat models vs IDE assistants vs specialist tools).\nA mental model for how LLMs work at a useful, developer-friendly level.\nA realistic view of benefits and failure modes (hallucinations, shallow tests, brittle outputs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week frames AI coding tools as an “extra pair of hands” for experienced developers. The promise is not magic — it’s leverage:\n\nfaster scaffolding\nfaster iteration\nearlier bug discovery\nimproved test coverage\n\n\n“…reduced implementation time by approximately 30%, while improving code quality…”\n\nThe course lens: real world means we care about:\n\npractical constraints\nmaintainability\nsecurity\ncorrectness\nteam workflows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI refers to models that produce new content (text, code, images) based on learned patterns. For coding, the relevant output types are:\n\ncode snippets (functions, classes, scripts)\nrefactors (changing structure without changing behaviour)\ntests (unit tests, fuzz tests, property-based tests)\ndocumentation (docstrings, READMEs, API docs)\n\n\n\n\nThis week highlights several practical use cases. We’ll treat these as work modes you can switch between.\n\n\nThis is the “pair programmer” mode. You describe what you want, and the tool produces starter code.\nKey reality check:\n\ngenerated code is rarely perfect\nit is often plausible\nyou must still review and test\n\n\n“…anticipates patterns, and generates implementation details…”\n\n\n\n\nTools can propose patches quickly — especially for:\n\ncommon exceptions\nmisuse of APIs\noff-by-one errors\nmissing edge-case handling\n\nBut: AI doesn’t understand your logic. It matches patterns. If your bug is domain-specific, AI help may be weaker.\n\n\n\nAI is good at turning code into:\n\ndocstrings\nusage examples\n“how it works” summaries\n\nThe risk is confident incorrectness. Docs can become wrong faster than code. So you should treat AI-generated docs as a draft, not truth.\n\n\n\nAI can help with:\n\nextracting helper functions\nrenaming variables for clarity\nreorganising modules\nperformance suggestions\n\nBut optimisation suggestions can be dangerous if they change semantics. Always lock behaviour first with tests.\n\n\n\nAI is useful for producing lots of tests quickly. This is a big deal because tests are often the bottleneck.\nHowever:\n\nAI tests can be shallow\nAI may test implementation details instead of behaviour\n\nSo we’ll keep a rule of thumb:\n\nTest behaviour, not the code’s current shape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week separates tools into categories. You should be able to explain what each category is good for.\n\n\nThese include ChatGPT / Claude-style assistants. They are good for:\n\nexplaining concepts\ndrafting code in isolation\nbrainstorming designs\ngenerating documentation\n\nBut they can struggle with:\n\nlarge codebases\nproject-wide refactors\nkeeping context consistent\n\n\n\n\nThese integrate into editors (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.). They can:\n\nautocomplete in-place\nunderstand surrounding code context\nsuggest local refactors\n\n\n\n\nSome tools focus on a specific workflow:\n\ncode search + fixes\nsecurity checks\ntest generation\n\nThis week calls out tools like Cursor, Blackbox AI, and Tabnine later. Your skill as a developer is choosing the right tool for the task.\n\n“…practical guide to using AI tools to supercharge your coding…”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the part where people often get intimidated. This week’s key message is:\n\nyou don’t need the math\nyou do need the mental model\n\nWe’ll focus on what helps you predict failure modes.\n\n\nThink of a large language model (LLM) as:\n\na probability engine over sequences of tokens\ntrained to predict “what comes next”\n\nIt does not “know” facts the way humans do. It generates outputs that are statistically likely given its training.\n\n\n\nThis week describes internal steps like:\n\ninput embedding (tokens → vectors)\ntransformer layers (attention)\noutput decoding (vectors → tokens)\n\nWe’ll capture this with a diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Input prompt] --&gt; B[Tokenisation]\n  B --&gt; C[Embeddings]\n  C --&gt; D[Transformer layers&lt;br/&gt;attention + feedforward]\n  D --&gt; E[Next-token probabilities]\n  E --&gt; F[Sampling / decoding]\n  F --&gt; G[Output text/code]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“An LLM is a deep learning architecture based on the Transformer model…”\n\n\n\n\nAttention is what allows the model to:\n\n“focus” on relevant parts of the prompt\nrelate tokens across distance\nkeep patterns consistent (sometimes!)\n\nWhen you see a model forget instructions, it’s often because:\n\nthe prompt was too long\nthe instruction got buried\nthe model weighted other tokens as more relevant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn LLM is a model trained on huge amounts of text and code.

The potential is that AI tools can shift your role upward:\n\nfrom typing code → designing systems\nfrom debugging syntax → validating behaviour\nfrom writing boilerplate → reviewing structure\n\n\n\nIt usually means:\n\nfaster first drafts\nearlier working prototypes\nmore time spent on architecture\n\nBut only if you adopt a workflow that includes:\n\nreview\ntests\niteration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany students confuse these.

    "title": "Week 02: First steps with AI-assisted coding",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Micro-quote (Ch2): “Imagine having an intelligent assistant that helps you with coding.”\n\n\n\nThis week is your practical starting point: using an AI coding assistant while you write real code. This week uses GitHub Copilot as the main example and builds up three big ideas:\n\nAn assistant is only useful if you can communicate intent clearly.\nContext is the difference between “wow” and “why on earth did it do that”.\nSmall, repeatable patterns beat “magic prompts”.\n\nWe’ll work through:\n\nWhat Copilot is and how it behaves in an IDE\nThe main interaction modes (completion vs chat)\nCommon prompting patterns for code\nWhy context matters (and how to control it)\nA mini Python project (word frequency) that’s perfect for practicing AI-assisted workflow\n\n\n\nBy the end of Week 2, students should be able to:\n\nExplain what GitHub Copilot does (and what it does not do)\nUse code completion and chat-style assistance appropriately\nCreate stronger prompts inside the code editor using comments and structure\nControl context by isolating files, adding examples, and writing better docstrings\nBuild a small Python script that is correct, testable, and easy to extend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicro-quote (Ch2): “Do you remember the “rubber duck” debugging method?”\n\nThis week frames Copilot as a smarter rubber duck: a helper you can “talk to” while you’re coding.

The goal is to turn vague ideas into requirements you can implement.\nA requirement in this context is a short, testable statement of behaviour: what the user can do, or what the system must store/compute/display.\nA useful trick: rewrite each requirement as a user story: As a user, I want … so that ….\nRequirements are not only ‘features’. They also include constraints like performance, security, and maintainability.\nWhen you work with AI coding tools, requirements become even more important: they are the anchor that keeps generated code aligned with your intent.\nPractical decomposition pattern used in this week:\nStart with the smallest end-to-end ‘thin slice’ (a page that loads; a form that submits; a result that displays).\nList the minimal data objects you need (e.g., a question bank, callsigns, categories, logs).\nIdentify the ‘edges’: inputs (forms/API), outputs (HTML pages), and storage (files/DB).\nOnly then decide folder structure and module boundaries. \n\n\n\n\n\nPython projects should isolate libraries per project using a virtual environment (often abbreviated venv).\nIsolation matters because different projects need different versions of the same library (a common source of ‘works on my machine’ bugs).\nIn a first-year course, we care about this early because it teaches reproducibility and reduces setup friction later. ### Create and activate a venv\nCreate the environment in your project folder (name is conventional: .venv).\nActivate it before installing packages so installs go into the venv, not your global Python.\n\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux\n# .venv\\Scripts\\activate   # Windows (PowerShell)\npython -m pip install --upgrade pip\n\n\n\nThis week uses Flask as the minimal web framework: it’s small enough to understand without magic.\nTreat dependencies as part of your project: record them in requirements.txt so another machine can reproduce the same environment.\n\npip install flask\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore writing ‘real logic’, you create a project structure: folders for app code, templates, static assets, and tests.\nA structure is a communication tool: it tells future you (and teammates) where things belong.\nThis week’s key move is creating stubs: placeholder functions/routes that define the shape of the app before it is complete. ### A minimal, conventional Flask layout\n\nmyapp/\n  app.py\n  templates/\n    index.html\n  static/\n    style.css\n  requirements.txt\n  README.md\n\nYou can evolve this into a package layout (myapp/__init__.py) later. Start simple.\nKeep templates/ for HTML templates and static/ for CSS/JS/images, matching Flask conventions. \n\n\n\n\n\nA Flask app is basically a mapping from URLs to Python functions.\nEach mapping is a route. When a browser requests /, Flask calls the function and returns a response.\nYour job is to control: input → processing → output. ### The smallest runnable Flask app\n\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef home():\n    return \"Hello! Week 4 app is running.\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n\ndebug=True turns on debug mode: auto-reload + a helpful error page. Great for learning; disable in production.\nWhen something breaks, read the traceback top-to-bottom: it tells you where and often why. ### Running the app\n\npython app.py\n# Then open the printed URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/)\n\n\n\nA browser makes an HTTP request (method + path + headers + optional body).\nYour route function returns a response (status code + headers + body).\nEven when you ‘just return a string’, Flask wraps it into a full HTTP response. ## Templates and pages: keeping logic out of HTML {#templates-and-pages-keeping-logic-out-of-html}\nOnce you move beyond plain strings, you’ll render HTML templates.\nTemplates let you keep Python logic in Python and presentation in HTML.\nFlask uses Jinja2 templates; you inject values and loops into a mostly-normal HTML page. ### Example: render a template\n\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef home():\n    return render_template(\"index.html\", title=\"Real World AI\")\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Your Flask app is rendering templates.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nJinja placeholders like { title } are replaced at render time.\nWhen you later add forms, you’ll pass user-submitted values into templates to show results. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreat every external library as a dependency you must track.\nrequirements.txt is the simplest approach: it records exact versions so installs are consistent.\nA clean workflow: create venv → install deps → freeze → commit both code and requirements.\nIf a teammate can’t run your app, 80% of the time it’s: wrong venv, wrong Python, or missing deps. ### Recreating the environment from scratch\n\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\nThis week’s development rhythm is iterative: make a small change, run the app, observe, and repeat.\nThis is not just ‘coding style’ — it’s risk management. Small steps make bugs easier to locate.\nWhen using AI assistants, keep iterations even smaller: generate a tiny piece, test it, then proceed. ### A tiny iteration loop (conceptual)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  A[Write or generate small change] --&gt; B[Run unit of work]\n  B --&gt; C{Did it work?}\n  C -- Yes --&gt; D[Commit / move to next small change]\n  C -- No --&gt; E[Read error, reduce scope, fix]\n  E --&gt; A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenv not activated: pip install went to global Python; Flask isn’t found when running.\nWrong working directory: you run python app.py from a different folder and Flask can’t find templates/.\nPort already in use: another process is using 5000; you’ll see an ‘Address already in use’ message.\nTemplate errors: misspelt variable names in Jinja; look at the stack trace and the highlighted line.\nImport cycles when you split files too early: keep it simple until you understand module imports. ## Summing Up {#summing-up}\nWeek 04 is about moving from idea to a runnable first version.\nYou practised translating requirements into a project skeleton and basic routes.\nYou set up a virtual environment, installed Flask, and captured dependencies for reproducibility.\nYou learned the core web mental model: request → route → response, then grew it into templates.\nNext weeks build on this baseline by generating more code with AI tools and expanding the app’s features.\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain the difference between a feature request and an implementation detail.\nWhat does a virtual environment protect you from? Give two concrete examples.\nWhy is requirements.txt useful even for a tiny project?\nWhat is a route? How is it different from a function that is never called by Flask?\nWhat is the advantage of templates compared to building HTML with string concatenation?\nDescribe the iteration loop you should follow when using an AI assistant to generate code.\n\n\n\n\n\nA strong starting point is to list user actions, then map each to a URL.\nExample: ‘Start a practice session’ might map to /start, while ‘Submit an answer’ maps to /answer.\nThink about which actions change state (POST) versus which only read state (GET).\nEven if you ignore REST purity in week 4, using GET/POST correctly prevents common bugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly versions often avoid databases. You can store small state in memory while learning.\nBut remember: in-memory state resets when the server restarts.\nFor learning, this is fine — it encourages you to separate ‘core logic’ from ‘storage’.\nLater weeks can swap storage without rewriting everything if your code is modular.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen an error happens, copy the traceback and identify the first line in your codebase.\nAdd a print/log statement above that line to inspect variables.\nChange one thing at a time; rerun; confirm the effect.\nAvoid random guessing — it’s slower than systematic diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week’s core move is: design artefacts → requirements → code skeleton.\nA useful mental model is to treat every paragraph of your design document as one of:\n\na feature (something the user can do)\na constraint (a limit: performance, privacy, usability)\nan assumption (something you are betting is true)\nan open question (something you must resolve)\n\nIf you can’t label a paragraph, it’s often “hand-wavy” and needs rewriting.\nA simple requirement format (good enough for first year) is:\n\nAs a &lt;type of user&gt;\nI want &lt;capability&gt;\nSo that &lt;benefit&gt;\n\nThen add acceptance criteria:\n\n“Given … when … then …” statements (these become tests later).\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose your design doc says the app should help someone prepare for an exam.\nTurn that into requirements:\n\nAs a learner, I want to select a topic so I can practise questions.\nAs a learner, I want immediate feedback so I can correct misconceptions.\nAs a learner, I want progress tracking so I can focus on weak areas.\n\nNotice how this immediately suggests data structures and routes.\n\n# A tiny starting point: represent requirements as data\nrequirements = [\n    {\"as\": \"learner\", \"want\": \"select a topic\", \"so_that\": \"practise questions\"},\n    {\"as\": \"learner\", \"want\": \"immediate feedback\", \"so_that\": \"correct misconceptions\"},\n    {\"as\": \"learner\", \"want\": \"progress tracking\", \"so_that\": \"focus on weak areas\"},\n]\n\n# Later, you might render this in a template or export to JSON.\nimport json\nprint(json.dumps(requirements, indent=2))\n\nThis is intentionally “low-tech” — the goal is to reduce ambiguity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 04 emphasises a repeatable environment because web apps are dependency-heavy.\nTwo common mistakes by beginners:\n\ninstalling packages “globally” and then not remembering what you installed\nforgetting to activate the virtual environment and installing into the wrong place\n\nA virtual environment is just a folder containing:\n\na Python interpreter\nsite-packages (third-party libraries)\nscripts for activation\n\n\n\n\npython -m venv .venv\n\n# macOS / Linux\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\n# Windows (PowerShell)\n# .venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n\nIf activation worked, your shell prompt usually changes (e.g., shows (.venv)).\nIf you get “permission” errors on Windows PowerShell, you may need to adjust the execution policy.\n\n\n\n\npython -m pip install --upgrade pip\npip install flask\n\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\ncat requirements.txt\n\nrequirements.txt is a “snapshot” of your environment.\nLater chapters build on this to make the project easier to share and deploy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chapter’s approach is basically: create stubs first, then fill them in.\nA stub is a small piece of code that compiles/runs but doesn’t do much yet.\n\n\n\n\nThe chapter’s screenshots illustrate a clean starting structure.\nA common layout is:\n\nmyapp/\n  app.py\n  templates/\n    index.html\n  static/\n    style.css\n  requirements.txt\n  README.md\n\nWhy separate templates/ and static/?\n\ntemplates are rendered by Flask (HTML with placeholders)\nstatic files are served directly (CSS, images, JS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse these figures as reminders of the “shape” of a small web app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents often think “Flask runs my code top-to-bottom each time”. Not quite.\nIn a Flask server:\n\nPython starts once\nFlask registers routes (URL patterns)\nthen waits for requests\n\nWhen a request arrives, Flask:\n\nmatches the URL to a route\ncalls the function for that route\nreturns the response\n\n\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef home():\n    # This runs when the browser requests / (not when the file is imported)\n    return \"Hello from Week 4\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n\ndebug=True is a development convenience:\n\nauto-reloads when files change\nshows a helpful debug page on errors\n\nYou must disable debug mode for production.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4 pushes you toward templates early, which is good practice.\nTemplates help you avoid mixing Python logic with HTML.\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- templates/index.html --&gt;\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;{{ heading }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Today we are building the first version.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return render_template(\"index.html\", title=\"Week 4\", heading=\"Hello, Flask\")\n\nKey idea: render_template fills placeholders like { title }.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4 is where the temptation to “let the AI write the whole app” becomes strong.\nThe safe workflow is:\n\nyou define the requirements and the “shape” of the app\nyou ask the AI for small deltas (a route, a template, a helper function)\nyou run the code and inspect the results\n\nA good prompt pattern is:\n\ngive the current file structure\nspecify the exact change\nrequire that the output is a patch/diff\n\n\nYou are helping me with a Flask app.\nCurrent structure:\n- app.py\n- templates/index.html\nTask: add a new route GET /about that renders templates/about.html.\nConstraints:\n- keep app.py minimal\n- do not add new dependencies\nReturn: the full updated app.py and new about.html\n\nThis kind of prompt reduces “AI drift” (the model inventing extra features).\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are a few short phrases from Chapter 4 that capture the intent:\n\n“we’re diving headfirst into the wild world”\n“building a useful application”\n“integrating these tools into your workflow”\n\nUse these as “north stars”: the goal is a working workflow, not perfect code.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you start coding:\n\nyou can explain the user goal in one sentence\nyou can list 3–5 requirements\nyou know what data your app needs to store (even if it’s just in memory)\n\nWhen you set up the project:\n\nyou created .venv/\nyou can activate it\npython -m pip -V points inside .venv/\n\nWhen you run Flask:\n\nyou can visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/\nyou can change a file and see it reload\nyou can read a stack trace when it breaks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4 is where your project becomes “real”: an app skeleton you can run.\nThe highest-value skills from this week:\n\nturning a vague design idea into concrete requirements\ncreating a reproducible Python environment\nbuilding stubs first, then iterating\nunderstanding the request/response cycle\nusing AI tools in small, testable steps",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Why testing matters in AI-assisted coding\nKey terms you must be able to use\nAI-assisted test generation workflow\nunittest vs pytest and when to use each\nIn-memory databases for isolated tests\nPrompting patterns for high-quality tests\nEvaluating and fixing AI-generated tests\nCommon failure modes and how to debug\nUsing generated tests in CI\nSumming up\n\n\n\n\nWeek 08 focuses on using generative AI to produce tests, but this week is really about trust.\nA test suite is your “contract” with future you: it describes what must stay true as code changes.\nAI can write tests quickly, but speed is useless if the tests are brittle, shallow, or wrong.\n“Generative AI tools are changing this boring, repetitive process.”\n“They can automatically create detailed test suites, spot edge cases, and generate boilerplate code.”\nIn AI-assisted workflows, tests do two jobs at once:\n\ncatch regressions, and 2) detect when the AI has hallucinated an API, edge case, or assumption.\n\nA bad test suite can make things worse by giving you false confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\ntest oracle — what counts as correct output (and what your test is really asserting).\nfixture — a repeatable setup/teardown wrapper that makes tests readable and reliable.\nmock — a controlled stand‑in that isolates your code from external systems.\nin‑memory database — a temporary database (often SQLite) used for fast, isolated tests.\nregression test — a test that locks in behaviour so future changes don’t break it.\nproperty‑based testing — testing broad invariants by generating many inputs automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart by writing a clear spec (even if it is only a paragraph). AI cannot test what you cannot describe.\nDecide what level you are testing: unit (small), integration (multiple parts), or end-to-end (system).\nGive the AI: the function signature, expected behaviour, edge cases, and any invariants.\nAsk for tests and a short explanation of why each test exists.\n“This week shows how GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, and Blackbox AI can enhance your testing workflow.”\nRun the tests immediately. If they fail, treat that as feedback about either the code or the prompt.\nRefactor the generated tests: rename, remove duplicates, add missing assertions, and simplify setup.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth frameworks can express the same logic; the difference is ergonomics and ecosystem conventions.\nunittest is batteries-included and class-based; pytest is function-first and heavily fixture-driven.\nIf a project already uses one, prefer consistency over personal preference.\nAI tends to produce verbose unittest boilerplate unless you explicitly ask for pytest.\n“They can help you build strong, maintain­ able test suites quickly, while upholding quality.”\nAsk the AI to follow your project’s test naming and folder conventions.\nDo not accept tests that assert implementation details (e.g., exact SQL query strings) unless required.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn in-memory DB makes tests fast and isolated: every test starts from a clean slate.\nThis week demonstrates creating temporary databases and seeding minimal data for reproducibility.\n“211 Why use generative AI for testing?”\nKey idea: tests should not depend on a developer’s local environment (paths, ports, or existing data).\nWhen you use SQLite in-memory, ensure your app’s DB layer can accept a connection string override.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse prompts that are specific about assertions, not just “write tests”.\nAlways list edge cases you care about (empty inputs, None/null, boundary values, malformed data).\nIf you want parameterised tests, say so explicitly.\nIf you want mocks, name the dependencies to mock and the behaviour they should simulate.\n“High-quality tests are vital for reliable software.”\nAsk for one test per behaviour: big “kitchen sink” tests are hard to debug.\nAsk the AI to include comments that link each test back to a requirement line.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreat AI-generated tests as a draft. Your job is to make them true and useful.\nCheck: does the test actually fail when the code is wrong?

For example, AAA222 would be an acceptable … vanity plate; AAA22A would not be acceptable. The first number used cannot be a ‘0’.”\n“No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed.”\n\nIn plates.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a vanity plate and then output Valid if meets all of the requirements or Invalid if it does not. Assume that any letters in the user’s input will be uppercase. Structure your program per the below, wherein is_valid returns True if s meets all requirements and False if it does not. Assume that s will be a str. You’re welcome to implement additional functions for is_valid to call (e.g., one function per requirement).\ndef main():\n    plate = input(\"Plate: \")\n    if is_valid(plate):\n        print(\"Valid\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid\")\n\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n    ...\n\n\nmain()\n\n\n\n\nRecall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.\nMuch like a list, a str is a “sequence” (of characters), which means it can be “sliced” into shorter strings with syntax like s[i:j]. For instance, if s is \"CS50\", then s[0:2] would be \"CS\".\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:\n$\n\nNext execute\nmkdir plates\n\nto make a folder called plates in your codespace.\nThen execute\ncd plates\n\nto change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as plates/ $. You can now execute\ncode plates.py\n\nto make a file called plates.py where you’ll write your program.\n\n\n\nHere’s how to test your code manually:\n\nRun your program with python plates.py. Type CS50 and press Enter. Your program should output:\nValid\n\nRun your program with python plates.py. Type CS05 and press Enter. Your program should output:\nInvalid\n\nRun your program with python plates.py. Type CS50P and press Enter. Your program should output\nInvalid\n\nRun your program with python plates.py.

    "text": "In the United States, dates are typically formatted in month-day-year order (MM/DD/YYYY), otherwise known as middle-endian order, which is arguably bad design. Dates in that format can’t be easily sorted because the date’s year comes last instead of first. Try sorting, for instance, 2/2/1800, 3/3/1900, and 1/1/2000 chronologically in any program (e.g., a spreadsheet). Dates in that format are also ambiguous. Harvard was founded on September 8, 1636, but 9/8/1636 could also be interpreted as August 9, 1636!\nFortunately, computers tend to use ISO 8601, an international standard that prescribes that dates should be formatted in year-month-day (YYYY-MM-DD) order, no matter the country, formatting years with four digits, months with two digits, and days with two digits, “padding” each with leading zeroes as needed.\nIn a file called outdated.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a date, anno Domini, in month-day-year order, formatted like 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636, wherein the month in the latter might be any of the values in the list below:\n[\n    \"January\",\n    \"February\",\n    \"March\",\n    \"April\",\n    \"May\",\n    \"June\",\n    \"July\",\n    \"August\",\n    \"September\",\n    \"October\",\n    \"November\",\n    \"December\"\n]\n\nThen output that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the user’s input is not a valid date in either format, prompt the user again. Assume that every month has no more than 31 days; no need to validate whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.\n\n\n\nRecall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods, including split.\nRecall that a list comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists, among which is index.\nNote that you can format an int with leading zeroes with code like\nprint(f\"{n:02}\")\n\nwherein, if n is a single digit, it will be prefixed with one 0, per docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax.\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window.

And after three incorrect answers for the same problem, the toy would simply display the correct answer (e.g., 4 + 0 = 4 or 4 + 1 = 5).\nIn a file called professor.py, implement a program that:\n\nPrompts the user for a level, (n). If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.\nRandomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with (n) digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).\n\nNote: The order in which you generate x and y matters. Your program should generate random numbers in x, y pairs to simulate generating one math question at a time (e.g., x0 with y0, x1 with y1, and so on).\n\nPrompts the user to solve each of those problems. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.\nThe program should ultimately output the user’s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.\n\nStructure your program as follows, wherein get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts) the user for a level and returns 1, 2, or 3, and generate_integer returns a single randomly generated non-negative integer with level digits or raises a ValueError if level is not 1, 2, or 3:\nimport random\n\n\ndef main():\n    ...\n\n\ndef get_level():\n    ...\n\n\ndef generate_integer(level):\n    ...\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n\n\n\nNote that you can raise an exception like ValueError with code like:\nraise ValueError\n\nNote that the random module comes with quite a few functions, per docs.python.org/3/library/random.html.

    "text": "One way to measure the complexity of a program is to count its number of lines of code (LOC), excluding blank lines and comments. For instance, a program like\n# Say hello\n\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\nprint(f\"hello, {name}\")\n\nhas just two lines of code, not four, since its first line is a comment, and its second line is blank (i.e., just whitespace). That’s not that many, so odds are the program isn’t that complex. Of course, just because a program (or even function) has more lines of code than another doesn’t necessarily mean it’s more complex. For instance, a function like\ndef is_even(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nisn’t really twice as complex as a function like\ndef is_even(n):\n    return n % 2 == 0\n\neven though the former has (more than) twice as many lines of code. In fact, the former might arguably be simpler if it’s easier to read! So lines of code should be taken with a grain of salt.\nEven so, in a file called lines.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file, excluding comments and blank lines. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified file’s name does not end in .py, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.\nAssume that any line that starts with #, optionally preceded by whitespace, is a comment. (A docstring should not be considered a comment.) Assume that any line that only contains whitespace is blank.\n\n\n\nRecall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods, including lstrip and startswith.\nNote that open can raise a FileNotFoundError, per docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError.\nYou might find it helpful to test your program on, e.g., some of Week 6’s source code as well as on programs of your own.\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window.

But each # should be a number between 0 and 255, inclusive. Suffice it to say 275 is not in that range! If only NUMB3RS had validated the address in that scene!\nIn a file called numb3rs.py, implement a function called validate that expects an IPv4 address as input as a str and then returns True or False, respectively, if that input is a valid IPv4 address or not.\nStructure numb3rs.py as follows, wherein you’re welcome to modify main and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not import any other libraries. You’re welcome, but not required, to use re and/or sys.\nimport re\nimport sys\n\n\ndef main():\n    print(validate(input(\"IPv4 Address: \")))\n\n\ndef validate(ip):\n    ...\n\n\n...\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nEither before or after you implement validate in numb3rs.py, additionally implement, in a file called test_numb3rs.py, two or more functions that collectively test your implementation of validate thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:\npytest test_numb3rs.py\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the re module comes with quite a few functions, per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html, including search.\nRecall that regular expressions support quite a few special characters, per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax.\nBecause backslashes in regular expressions could be mistaken for escape sequences (like \\n), best to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns, else pytest will warn with DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence. Just as format strings are prefixed with f, so are raw strings prefixed with r. For instance, instead of \"harvard\\.edu\", use r\"harvard\\.edu\".\nNote that re.search, if passed a pattern with “capturing groups” (i.e., parentheses), returns a “match object,” per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects, wherein matches are 1-indexed, which you can access individually with group, per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.group, or collectively with groups, per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.groups.\n\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window.

You may not alter these methods’ parameters, but you may add your own methods.\nclass Jar:\n    def __init__(self, capacity=12):\n        ...\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        ...\n\n    def deposit(self, n):\n        ...\n\n    def withdraw(self, n):\n        ...\n\n    @property\n    def capacity(self):\n        ...\n\n    @property\n    def size(self):\n        ...\n\nEither before or after you implement jar.py, additionally implement, in a file called test_jar.py, four or more functions that collectively test your implementation of Jar thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:\npytest test_jar.py\n\nNote that it’s not as easy to test instance methods as it is to test functions alone, since instance methods sometimes manipulate the same “state” (i.e., instance variables). To test one method (e.g., withdraw), then, you might need to call another method first (e.g., deposit). But the method you call first might itself not be correct!\nAnd so programmers sometimes mock (i.e., simulate) state when testing methods, as with Python’s own mock object library, so that you can call just the one method but modify the underlying state first, without calling the other method to do so.\nFor simplicity, though, no need to mock any state. Implement your tests as you normally would!\n\n\nfrom jar import Jar\n\n\ndef test_init():\n    ...\n\n\ndef test_str():\n    jar = Jar()\n    assert str(jar) == \"\"\n    jar.deposit(1)\n    assert str(jar) == \"🍪\"\n    jar.deposit(11)\n    assert str(jar) == \"🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪\"\n\n\ndef test_deposit():\n    ...\n\n\ndef test_withdraw():\n    ...\n\nYou’re welcome, but not required, to implement a main function, so this is all we can demo!\n\n\n\nCookie Monster\n\n\nSource: Sesame Street\n\n\n\nExecute cd by itself in your terminal window.
