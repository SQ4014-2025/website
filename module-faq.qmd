## Flipped Classroom: Can I still come to lecture if I don't watch the videos and go through the notes for that week before class?

Yes, of course you can and should! But...

The point of the flipped classroom is to maximise the time spent in class discussing and solving problems. If you don't watch the videos and go through the notes for that week before class, you will miss out on this and potentially fall behind while others are getting on with their problem set work during classtime.

## Can I just code on my own computer?

The short answer is, heck yeah!!, with caveats.

Installing and configuring programming and editing software on your own computer is sometimes complicated and irritating, even for very experienced people. Configuring all the tools we will be using in The Sandbox to be exactly the same on your own computer, operating system, etc., will require advanced skills. Still, you can attempt to do it if you want to; most of the tools are open source and free and will work for most tasks. Also, we are here to help support you if you want to try.
