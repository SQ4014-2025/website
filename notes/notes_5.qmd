## Using Blackbox AI to generate base code {#using-blackbox-ai-to-generate-base-code}

-   This week builds the next slice of the HAM radio practice-exam app using **Blackbox AI** as your "code draft engine".
-   This week's theme is not "let AI build everything." It's **co-development**: you steer architecture; AI accelerates implementation.

A good sentence to keep in mind from this week:

-   "The goal is to demonstrate effective cooperation between human expertise and AI."

### Key terms you must own by the end of this week

-   **Blackbox AI** — a coding assistant used here to generate base implementations quickly, especially for repetitive web-app scaffolding.
-   **Persistent session** — a user state that survives across requests (in Flask, commonly via signed cookies + server-side data decisions).
-   **Separation of concerns** — keeping responsibilities split (routes vs data access vs domain logic), so fixes don’t ripple everywhere.
-   **Question set** — a reproducible list of question IDs that defines an exam attempt (so the test can be resumed/graded).
-   **Test session** — a database record that tracks a user’s progress through a question set (position, answers, score).

## Application development with generative AI tools {#application-development-with-generative-ai-tools}

-   The author frames AI tools as a multiplier: you still need to decide *what the system is* and *where things live* (files/modules/classes).
-   A practical mental model: treat the assistant like a very fast junior developer—great at drafting, weak at reading your mind.

From this week's "what this covers" list, one line basically describes the architectural bar:

-   "¡ Maintain separation of concerns—Even fast development benefits from clean architecture."

What that means in practice:

-   You can accept AI-generated code as a *starting point*, but you should refactor it into your architecture.
-   When the AI suggests putting everything into one file, you should resist. This week is about improving structure while moving fast.

### Prompting as a software skill

-   Prompts are interfaces. If your prompt is vague, the “API response” (generated code) will be unpredictable.
-   If your prompt is too rigid, you’ll spend more time fighting the output than writing code yourself.
-   The sweet spot is a *well-scoped* prompt that includes context + constraints + expected behaviour.

Two short reminders from this week:

-   "This prompt will tell Blackbox what we want it to do and give specificity."
-   "Treat the comment as a prompt."

## Setting up the development environment {#setting-up-the-development-environment}

-   This week assumes you already have a working Flask project from earlier weeks.
-   You’re now adding *state*: question sets and test sessions need to persist across pages and across time.

Minimum local setup (student-friendly):

-   Create a virtual environment and install Flask.
-   Decide where your database file lives (for a student project, a local SQLite file is fine).
-   Ensure your project has a clear module boundary between routes and data access.

A minimal runnable Flask skeleton:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.get("/")
def index():
    return {"status": "ok"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Developing core features {#developing-core-features}

-   This week’s development plan is incremental: add the database layer, wire it to the UI, then improve architecture.
-   This is where “separation of concerns” stops being an academic phrase and becomes a survival tool.

### Creating the database {#creating-the-database}

The author’s first instinct is direct:

-   "I start with the database."

Why start here?

-   Web apps are stateful experiences built on stateless HTTP. If you don’t persist state, you’ll rebuild it on every request (painful).
-   A database is the simplest shared memory for user progress (even if you later swap SQLite for Postgres).

Another sentence in this week explains the concrete requirement:

-   "Now I just need to create a table that will store these IDs and some session data for our students."

#### A sane starter schema

-   `question_sets`: store a reproducible list of question IDs for an exam attempt.
-   `test_sessions`: store progress through a question set (index, answers, score).

Runnable SQLite setup (creates tables):

```python
import sqlite3

DB_PATH = "week05_demo.sqlite"

schema_sql = """
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS question_sets (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  question_ids TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_sessions (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  question_set_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  current_index INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY(question_set_id) REFERENCES question_sets(id)
);
"""

with sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH) as conn:
    conn.executescript(schema_sql)

print("OK: tables created in", DB_PATH)
```

### Connecting to our database {#connecting-to-our-database}

This week uses SQLite for simplicity. The key engineering decision is **where** to put connection logic.

-   Good: `db.py` (or `database.py`) owns connection creation, and other modules import helper functions.
-   Risky: every route creates its own SQL strings and connections inline (hard to test, hard to debug).

A minimal “db helper” module pattern:

```python
# db.py
import sqlite3
from pathlib import Path

DB_PATH = Path("week05_demo.sqlite")

def get_conn():
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)
    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
    return conn
```

### Calling our database from the frontend {#calling-our-database-from-the-frontend}

-   The UI needs to request “the next question” and submit “an answer”.
-   The backend needs to read/write the current test session (progress, scoring).

A minimal pattern: use routes as thin controllers; keep SQL out of the route when possible.

### Refactoring our Questions class {#refactoring-our-questions-class}

-   As features grow, a “Questions” class tends to become a dumping ground.
-   Refactoring here is about separating: (1) question bank access, (2) question selection, (3) rendering/formatting.

### Modifying our entry point (App.py) {#modifying-our-entry-point-app-py}

-   Entry points tend to accumulate imports, global objects, and configuration.
-   This week nudges you toward clarity: keep initialization in one place, but push functionality into modules.

### Pulling a set of questions {#pulling-a-set-of-questions}

-   A **question set** is your “frozen exam”. Once created, you should be able to reproduce it exactly.
-   This prevents the classic bug where refreshing the page gives a different test.

### Creating a test session in the database {#creating-a-test-session-in-the-database}

-   A **test session** is a record that points to a question set + stores progress.
-   This is also where session cookies + DB state meet: cookie identifies the browser; DB stores the durable progress.

A student-friendly session cookie setup in Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, session

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = "dev-only-change-me"  # in real apps, use env vars

@app.get("/set")
def set_value():
    session["user_id"] = 123
    return {"ok": True}

@app.get("/get")
def get_value():
    return {"user_id": session.get("user_id")}
```

### Creating code for the test session {#creating-code-for-the-test-session}

-   This week’s practical point: let AI draft the route handlers, but you must ensure they call *your* data layer cleanly.
-   Keep the contract obvious: `create_session(question_set_id) -> session_id` and `get_session(session_id) -> record`.

### Generating a question set {#generating-a-question-set}

-   Generating here means: selecting question IDs (not generating new questions).
-   You want deterministic reproducibility: store the IDs you chose.

### Verifying our test session was created {#verifying-our-test-session-was-created}

-   Verification is not optional. AI makes it easy to write code that “looks right” but fails at runtime.
-   Check: DB rows exist, foreign keys match, and the UI can resume where it left off.

A tiny verification query (runnable):

```python
import sqlite3

DB_PATH = "week05_demo.sqlite"
with sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH) as conn:
    qs = conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM question_sets").fetchone()[0]
    ts = conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test_sessions").fetchone()[0]

print({"question_sets": qs, "test_sessions": ts})
```

## Summing Up {#summing-up}

-   This week is a case study in using **Blackbox AI** for speed while still enforcing architecture.
-   The most important engineering idea is **separation of concerns**: routes orchestrate, domain logic decides, data layer persists.
-   The product outcome is a test experience that can persist progress across pages: **question sets** + **test sessions**.

## Extra notes: common failure modes when using AI drafts {#extra-notes-common-failure-modes}

-   Mixing layers: SQL and HTML string-building inside routes leads to fragile code.
-   Hidden state: relying only on cookies without DB persistence breaks resuming tests.
-   Unverified assumptions: AI may invent library functions or routes that do not exist.
-   Over-trusting generated code: always run, print, and inspect DB rows early.
