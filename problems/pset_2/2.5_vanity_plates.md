# Vanity Plates

In the UK, like in a lot of places, it’s possible to [request a vanity registration plate for your vehicle](https://www.gov.uk/buy-a-personalised-registration-number) for your car, with your choice of letters and numbers instead of random ones. 

Imagine these requirements:

* “All vanity plates must start with at least two letters.”
* “… vanity plates may contain a maximum of 6 characters (letters or numbers) and a minimum of 2 characters.”
* “Numbers cannot be used in the middle of a plate; they must come at the end. For example, AAA222 would be an acceptable … vanity plate; AAA22A would not be acceptable. The first number used cannot be a ‘0’.”
* “No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed.”

In `plates.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a vanity plate and then output `Valid` if meets all of the requirements or `Invalid` if it does not. Assume that any letters in the user’s input will be uppercase. Structure your program per the below, wherein `is_valid` returns `True` if `s` meets all requirements and `False` if it does not. Assume that `s` will be a `str`. You’re welcome to implement additional functions for `is_valid` to call (e.g., one function per requirement).

```
def main():
    plate = input("Plate: ")
    if is_valid(plate):
        print("Valid")
    else:
        print("Invalid")


def is_valid(s):
    ...


main()

```

## Hints

* Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per [docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).
* Much like a `list`, a `str` is a “sequence” (of characters), which means it can be “[sliced](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations)” into shorter strings with syntax like `s[i:j]`. For instance, if `s` is `"CS50"`, then `s[0:2]` would be `"CS"`.

## Before You Begin

Execute `cd` by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window's prompt resembles the below:

```
$

```

Next execute

```
mkdir plates

```

to make a folder called `plates` in your codespace.

Then execute

```
cd plates

```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `plates/ $`. You can now execute

```
code plates.py

```

to make a file called `plates.py` where you’ll write your program.

## How to Test

Here’s how to test your code manually:

* Run your program with `python plates.py`. Type `CS50` and press Enter. Your program should output:

  ```
  Valid

  ```
* Run your program with `python plates.py`. Type `CS05` and press Enter. Your program should output:

  ```
  Invalid

  ```
* Run your program with `python plates.py`. Type `CS50P` and press Enter. Your program should output

  ```
  Invalid

  ```
* Run your program with `python plates.py`. Type `PI3.14` and press Enter. Your program should output

  ```
  Invalid

  ```
* Run your program with `python plates.py`. Type `H` and press Enter. Your program should output

  ```
  Invalid

  ```
* Run your program with `python plates.py`. Type `OUTATIME` and press Enter. Your program should output

  ```
  Invalid

  ```
