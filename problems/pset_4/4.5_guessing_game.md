# Guessing Game

---

I’m thinking of a number between 1 and 100…

What is it?

It’s 50! But what if it were more random?

In a file called `game.py`, implement a program that:

* Prompts the user for a level, \(n\). If the user does not input a positive integer, the program should prompt again.
* Randomly generates an integer between 1 and \(n\), inclusive, using the `random` module.
* Prompts the user to guess that integer. If the guess is not a positive integer, the program should prompt the user again.
  + If the guess is smaller than that integer, the program should output `Too small!` and prompt the user again.
  + If the guess is larger than that integer, the program should output `Too large!` and prompt the user again.
  + If the guess is the same as that integer, the program should output `Just right!` and exit.

## Hints

* Note that the `random` module comes with quite a few functions, per [docs.python.org/3/library/random.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html). Of particular interest, perhaps, are the functions specialized for returning integers, such as `randint` and `randrange`.

## Before You Begin

Execute `cd` by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window's prompt resembles the below:

```
$

```

Next execute

```
mkdir game

```

to make a folder called `game` in your codespace.

Then execute

```
cd game

```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `game/ $`. You can now execute

```
code game.py

```

to make a file called `game.py` where you’ll write your program.

## How to Test

Here’s how to test your code manually:

* Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `cat` at a prompt that says `Level:` and press Enter. Your program should reprompt you:

  ```
  Level:

  ```
* Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `-1` at a prompt that says `Level:` and press Enter. Your program should reprompt you:

  ```
  Level:

  ```
* Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `10` at a prompt that says `Level:` and press Enter. Your program should now be ready to accept guesses:

  ```
  Guess:

  ```
* Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `10` at a prompt that says `Level:` and press Enter. Then type `cat`. Your program should reprompt you:

  ```
  Guess:

  ```
* Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `10` at a prompt that says `Level:` and press Enter. Then type `-1`. Your program should reprompt you:

  ```
  Guess:

  ```
* Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `1` at a prompt that says `Level:` and press Enter. Then type `1`. Your program should output:

  ```
  Just right!

  ```

  There’s only one possible number the answer could be!
* Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `10` at a prompt that says `Level:` and press Enter. Then type `100`. Your program should output:

  ```
  Too large!

  ```

  Looks like you’re guessing outside the range you specified.
* Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `10000` at a prompt that says `Level:` and press Enter. Then type `1`. Your program should output:

  ```
  Too small!

  ```

  Most likely, anyways: you might get lucky and see `Just right!`. But it would certainly be odd for you to see `Just right!` every time. And certainly you shouldn’t see `Too large!`.
