# Testing my twttr

---

In a file called `twttr.py`, reimplement [Setting up my twttr](../../2/twttr/) from [Problem Set 2](../../2/), restructuring your code per the below, wherein `shorten` expects a `str` as input and returns that same `str` but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

```
def main():
    ...


def shorten(word):
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Then, in a file called `test_twttr.py`, implement **one or more** functions that collectively test your implementation of `shorten` thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with `test_` so that you can execute your tests with:

```
pytest test_twttr.py

```

## Hints

* Be sure to include

  ```
  import twttr

  ```

  or

  ```
  from twttr import shorten

  ```

  atop `test_twttr.py` so that you can call `shorten` in your tests.
* Take care to `return`, not `print`, a `str` in `shorten`. Only `main` should call `print`.

## Before You Begin

Execute `cd` by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window's prompt resembles the below:

```
$

```

Next execute

```
mkdir test_twttr

```

to make a folder called `test_twttr` in your codespace.

Then execute

```
cd test_twttr

```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `test_twttr/ $`. You can now execute

```
code test_twttr.py

```

to make a file called `test_twttr.py` where you’ll write your tests.

## How to Test

To test your tests, run `pytest test_twttr.py`. Be sure you have a copy of a `twttr.py` file in the same folder. Try to use correct and incorrect versions of `twttr.py` to determine how well your tests spot errors:

* Ensure you have a correct version of `twttr.py`. Run your tests by executing `pytest test_twttr.py`. `pytest` should show that all of your tests have passed.
* Modify the correct version of `twttr.py` in such a way as to create a bug. Your program might, for example, mistakenly only omit lowercase vowels! Run your tests by executing `pytest test_twttr.py`. `pytest` should show that at least one of your tests has failed.
