# Response Validation

---

When creating a [Google Form](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) that prompts users for a short answer (or paragraph), it’s possible to enable [response validation](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3378864) and require that the user’s input match a [regular expression](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1371415). For instance, you could require that a user input an email address with a regex like [this one](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#valid-e-mail-address):

```
^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+\/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$

```

Or you could more easily use Google’s built-in support for validating an email address, per the screenshot below, much like you could use a library in your own code:

In a file called `response.py`, using either [validator-collection](https://pypi.org/project/validator-collection/) or [validators](https://github.com/kvesteri/validators) from PyPI, implement a program that prompts the user for an email address via `input` and then prints `Valid` or `Invalid`, respectively, if the input is a syntatically valid email address. You may not use `re`. And do not validate whether the email address’s domain name actually exists.

## Hints

* Note that you can install validator-collection with:

  ```
  pip install validator-collection

  ```

  It may be useful to find your way to the [library’s documentation](https://pypi.org/project/validator-collection/).
  
* Note that you can install validators with:

  ```
  pip install validators

  ```

  Click **Homepage** to find your way to the library’s documentation.

## Before You Begin

Execute `cd` by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window's prompt resembles the below:

```
$

```

Next execute

```
mkdir response

```

to make a folder called `response` in your codespace.

Then execute

```
cd response

```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `response/ $`. You can now execute

```
code response.py

```

to make a file called `response.py` where you’ll write your program.

## How to Test

Here’s how to test your code manually:

* Run your program with `python response.py`. Ensure your program prompts you for an email, then type `malan@harvard.edu`, followed by Enter. Your program should output `Valid`.
* Run your program with `python response.py`. Type your own email, followed by Enter. Your program should output `Valid`.
* Run your program with `python response.py`. Type `malan@@@harvard.edu`, followed by Enter. Your program should output `Invalid`.
* Run your program with `python response.py`. Mistype your own email, including an extra `.` before `.com`, for example. Press enter and your program should output `Invalid`.
